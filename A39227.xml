         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE Commemoration of the Humiliation, Sufferings and Death of Jeſus Chriſt, is a principal part of the Food of Faith, whereby we live in Chriſt, walk with him, and worſhip him: And to the end that we might ſo live, walk and worſhip, he hath inſtituted the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lord's Supper in his Church, to be an eminent part of his worſhip, and hath ſaid, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26. <hi>Take, eat, this doe in remembrance of me; take, drink, this doe in remembrance of me; for ſo oft as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye doe ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> And his death is incluſive of all his Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I know that it is a very uſeful point the Lord make it fruitful.</p>
               <p>In this work ſome conſiderations are neceſſary to be premiſed. The ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt are a wonderful part of the deep counſels of God, touching man. Gods great deſign is to glorifie himſelf, chiefly in thoſe great Attributes of his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and mercy, and to glorify Jeſus Chriſt to be the great Agent, to bring all the glory thereof unto God, according to the holy Covenant and agreement betwixt the Father and the Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6, <hi>&amp;c-</hi> To that end he purpoſed to make the whole maſs of mankind to glorifie his juſtice, an high and honourable ſervice for a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to perform.

When God executed his decrees, he made man in his own image and likeneſs [a bleſſed eſtate] gave him an holy juſt and good law, and power to perform it, brought him under an holy and juſt covenant, with incouragement and promiſe of immutable and eternal glory upon his keeping of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Doe and live,</hi> ſet him in the higheſt dignity of his creatures, to be Lord over the works of Gods own hands in this low world, gave him power to act by free choyce of his will, and thereby to act meritoriouſly [<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Law never had ſuch a perſon ſubject unto it, never did, nor could any other perform ſuch obedience as this glorious perſon performed, never were, or could be ſuch acts of obedience both active and paſſive performed, as were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe he is a publick perſon, by Office he is our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Surety: every act that he did was acted by virtue of his Office, in which Office he was from his firſt Incarnation, as it is teſtified by the Angel, <hi>Math.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſin,</hi> Luk. 2.11. <hi>unto you is born this day a Saviour in the City of</hi> David <hi>which is Chriſt the Lord,</hi> all that Jeſus Chriſt did and ſuffered were acts of his Office.

               <p>One conſideration more I ſhall add, to illuſtrate the wonderful ſufferings of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, by ſhewing that they do infinitely exceed all the ſufferings of man, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſufferings of the Elect in this life, or the ſufferings of the damned in Hell. Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered as a publick perſon, the puniſhment of all our ſin was laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.6. <hi>he laid upon him the iniquities of us all,</hi> he had no ſin of his own to ſuffer for, but <hi>he was made ſin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. and all our ſins were nailed to the croſs of Jeſus Chriſt, all the puniſhment due unto the ſin of all Gods Elect was laid upon him. The ſufferings of Chriſt were of value ſufficient to ſatisfie juſtice for all ſin: though in the application thereof unto us by the new Covenant only the Elect doe receive and partake of the benefit thereof. Sufferings of infinite value were neceſſary to redeem one Soul, and ſufferings of Infinite value are enough to redeem all the world, yea, many worlds. Our greateſt ſufferings (alaſs) are of ſmall value, we merit nothing but hell by our deepeſt ſufferings: our ſufferings at beſt are ſpotted and ſtained with ſin, and our ſufferings are but perſonal, not publick, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.4. <hi>the Soul that ſinneth it ſhall dye;</hi> we ſuffer for our ſins, not for the ſins of others. The ſufferings of Gods people are not penal, but medicinal, ſo much as may ſerve to purge out ſin, and no more, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27.9. and alas, a little ſerves the turn through the mercy of Jeſus Chriſt, and through the operation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The ſufferings of Chriſt are penal, he ſuffered the whole weight of the curſe till the Infinite vindictive juſtice of God was ſatisfied. <hi>O the Infinite weight of the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt!</hi> yea, the damned in hell ſuffer the vindictive wrath of God, but alas, they are finite and can bear but drops at once, they can never ſatisfie juſtice, and beſides, they ſuffer every one only for his own ſin. But Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65391:5"/> ſuffered the whole weight of Gods wrath due to all ſin, and all this at once, O the unconceivable depth of the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt! and O the Infinite value of them.</p>

               <p>In the firſt and laſt periods of the life of Jeſus Chriſt in the world, his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and paſſive obedience were moſt conſpicuous, in the intermediate periods of his life, his active obedience to the Law of God, was moſt conſpicuous, as will afterwards appear in the Hiſtory thereof. Though the conception of Jeſus Chriſt was exceeding glorious, above the dignity of any man that ever was born of a woman, yet was the morning of his life black and tempeſtuous, very dark accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Propheſy, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.2. <hi>as a tender plant, as a Root out of a dry ground,</hi> this I ſhall open in four particulars.</p>

               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the Angel whom God ſent to be his Meſſenger to manage and tranſact this glorious and divine work, <hi>Luk.</hi> 26.27. the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> was ſent from God, the time of the coming of this Angelical Meſſenger from God, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to be in the ſixth Moneth after <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> his conception, which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration will be of ſome uſe afterward, the place he came to was a City in <hi>Galilee</hi> of the Gentiles, named <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a place of little expectation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.46. <hi>Can any good thing come out of</hi> Nazareth? this is the place of the firſt ſpringing of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious branch Jeſus Chriſt, which is marked by <hi>Mathew,</hi> Math. 2.23. as the fulfilling of the Propheſies, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe Propheſies where Jeſus Chriſt is called the Branch, from which word that city had its Name.

               <p>The ſecond particular touching the dark morning of the Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt. Thus far the morning of the Incarnation of Jeſus Chri t was bright and glorious, but behold preſently a dark cloud ariſeth, which involveth both <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and the holy conception in her womb in bitter anguiſh and diſtreſs, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> muſt and did of neceſſity tell <hi>Joſeph</hi> that ſhe was with child, and that this matter befell her ſince their Eſpouſals, and opened to him all the Hiſtory of it, all that the Angel had ſaid, and that the effect of this divine viſion is, that ſhe is with child. This was amazing tidings to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he would ask her what Teſtimony, Evidence, or proof ſhe could bring, that theſe things were ſo as ſhe had ſaid; alaſs, there was no Teſtimony or proof to be made of theſe things, only <hi>Mary</hi> her ſelf in her own cauſe and defence. To be begotten with child after Eſpouſals, is by the Law of God a capital offence. ſuch incredible ſtories as you tell in your own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I have no rule to believe: I love you dearly, but I cannot, I may not believe you, and much leſs will the judges, or any body elſe give credit to your Apolog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

How bitterly would the ſword of this Law pierce through the godly heart of <hi>Mary?</hi> and how would it fill her Soul with ſuch diſtreſs, as would not a little affect the very conception of her womb? to be ſo near deſtruction, his Mother, who had conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, to be ſtoned to death at her Fathers dore, and that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But alas, this was but ſmall relief to innocent <hi>Mary,</hi> though her life, and her conception was by this means ſpared, yet the ſcandal remained, and the reproach of Incontinency and Whoredome in the Mother, and Illegitimacy on the child, and all this came upon them, not malitiouſly by adverſaryes, for then it might have been borne, but regularly by the Law of God, &amp; by <hi>Joſeph</hi> walking regularly, according to the Law of God, doing what he did in obedience to the Law, this was a bitter pill to them both.</p>
               <p>Oh the diſtreſſed cryes, prayers, tears, &amp; lamentations would their godly hearts be involved, drowned in! the diſtreſs was ſuch, that no creature could help them out of it, nor give counſel and advice in the caſe, only they cry to God, Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Mount. Now the Lord who uſeth to pity and relieve his children that cry unto him in their diſtreſs, relieved theſe his dear Children, as appeareth, <hi>Math.</hi> 1.20, 21. <hi>while Joſeph pondered on theſe things, behold the Angel of the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him in a dream, ſaying, Joſeph thou Son of David, fear not to take unto thee</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſhe ſhall bring forth a Son, and thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh what an eaſe and lifting up of heart was this to <hi>Joſeph!</hi> and what a fulneſs of confirmation of the Faith of <hi>Mary,</hi> and conſolation to her diſtreſſed Soul, when <hi>Ioſeph</hi> related the ſame unto her.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Ioſeph</hi> with all ſpeed conſummated (according to their publick manner) their marriage, and took her to his houſe. Yet they now both being divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the divinity of her Conception, and well knowing the promiſe of the Meſſiah, and the expectation of all Iſrael, of his coming about this time, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Divine Oracle, that this is he, by conſent and agreement, out of holy reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Lord, <hi>he knew her not till ſhe had brought forth her firſt born Son, and he called his Name Ieſus,</hi> Math. 1.25.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though the preſent breaking forth of this Scandal, was now divinely and wonderfully prevented from coming forth by <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> yet they were in danger that ſome degree of Scandal might break forth, by an over ſoon time of her Birth, and in that caſe they never want obſervers of the time of marriages, eſpecially when there be ſignal Characters upon the Parents, or concerning the Birth, as it was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in this caſe. But we ſhall ſee in the ſequel of the Hiſtory, that the Divine Providence of God did draw two Mantles over this danger, whereby the matter was put out of the reach of all obſervations of any man, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Mantle was, that by occaſion of <hi>Caeſars</hi> Taxation of all the world under his dominion, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were called, yea, compelled, though ſhe was big with child, to go to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> the City of <hi>David,</hi> and there the child was born, far
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65391:7"/> from home, where there was no body had any knowledge of theſe things, to make ſo critical an obſervation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Mantle was that by reaſon of <hi>Herods</hi> perſecution, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> with the child, were by Divine direction ſent away to <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they ſtayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two years, even till <hi>Herods</hi> death, after which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Lord called them home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and though they went and lived in their own City, yet now the child was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of two years old, and all thoughts of ſuch a curious obſervation, were utterly buryed in forgetfulneſs. So that the danger of a ſeeming Scandal, was quite co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by theſe two Mantles, which we ſhall again touch in the time of them.</p>
               <p>Now the Lord took care for the confirmation of the Faith of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and all the believers in thoſe times, and for the confirmation of our Faith, and the Faith of all the Churches to the Worlds end. And this the Lord brought about, by putting it into the heart of <hi>Mary</hi> to goe (with the conſent of her husband) to viſit her Couzen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> of whoſe Conception ſix Moneths before <hi>Maryes,</hi> the Angel had informed <hi>Mary.</hi> Now therefore this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly couple being agreed, in holy reverence to the Lord, to abſtain from the uſe of the marriage bed, <hi>Mary</hi> did ſpeedily upon the conſummation of the marriage, goe unto her Couzen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ver. 39. and <hi>Mary</hi> aroſe in thoſe dayes, and went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hill Country with haſte, into a City of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and entered into the houſe of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and ſaluted <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> And it came to paſs that when <hi>Elizabeth</hi> heard the Salutation of <hi>Mary,</hi> the babe leaped in her womb, and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and ſhe ſpake out with a loud voice, and ſaid, <hi>bleſſed art thou among Women, and bleſſed is the fruit of thy Womb. And whence is this to me, that the Mother of my Lord ſhould come unto me? for lo, ſo ſoon as the voice of thy Salutation ſounded in mine Ears, the babe leaped for joy, and bleſſed is ſhe that believed, for there ſhall be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe things which were told her from the Lo d.</hi> Vpon this Divine and Oraculous Speech of this holy Woman <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whoſe holineſs is recorded, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Zacharias and Elizabeth were both righteous before God, walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord blameleſs,</hi> by the mouth of this holy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did the Holy Ghoſt now ſpeak, upon which Speech many great things may he obſerved, for the confirmation of <hi>Maryes</hi> Faith and ours. <hi>Mary</hi> knew that no humane means had inform d <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of the great things that the Angel had ſaid unto her, and of her Conception by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, and of the great promiſes of God, which the Angel uttered touching her Son, it was the Holy Ghoſt that had informed her of all theſe things, and now the Holy Ghoſt filled the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I appeal in this caſe to the experience of all the Saints, that keep an holy watch. I mean not an extraordinary preſence of the Spirit, but ordinary. We are great loſers by being careleſs and ſlight in this great point of chriſtian converſation. The time of Maryes tarriance with her Couzen Elizabeth, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three moneths, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.56. <hi>and Mary abode with her about three moneths, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to her own houſe.</hi> Maryes conception of our Lord Jeſus, was about ſix months after the conception of John Baptiſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.36. <hi>this is the ſixth moneth with her, who was called barren.</hi> &amp; Mary tarrying about three months with her, yet returned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the birth of John, ſhe tarried till Elizabeth was very near her travail; for here are nine months mentioned. It were curioſity to enquire why ſhe tarried not till the birth of John. When ſhe came to Ioſeph, we ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> juſtly conceive that ſhe told him what had paſſed when ſhe came to her Couzen Elizabeth, for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Faith and joy. And now having gone three months of her time, it appeared evident to Joſeph, for the help of his Faith, that ſhe was indeed with child, as ſhe had ſaid unto him, and that all theſe wonderfull things which Mary had told him were true, though at firſt they ſeemed to him incredible. Thus did the Lord mightily confirm the Faith and joy of theſe two precious Saints, yea and of all believers to the worlds end.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In this dark morning of the incarnation of our Lord Jeſus before he was born, he was under a ſuffering that was great in the eyes of the Lord, that the Lord of Glory with his holy parents ſhould fall under a taxation by the great, proud Lords of the world, from which the children, and this child eſpecially, ſhould have been free; but goe they muſt to be taxed. And whether this taxation was out of pride, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> might ſee the vaſt numbers of his Subjects (once a great fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in good David) or whether it was out of covetouſneſs, to raiſe vaſt ſums of money upon every taxed head, or rather out of both theſe carnal principles; yet ſure enough it was an oppreſſion, a ſuffering that fell upon our Lord Jeſus before he was born.</p>
               <p>Yea further, this matter expoſed our Lord Jeſus to a very great danger of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, who knowing himſelf to be a uſurper of Davids crown, and being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly jealous of being outed of his Kingdome, and knowing alſo that all Iſrael was in expectation of the birth of the right Heir, who might out him of his Kingdome. Conſider what an opportunity was put into his hand by this taxation to find out the right heir, for the manner of numbring Iſrael, was by numbring the Tribes, and Families thereof: Now all the royal Family of David were called to be taxed at <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> the Regiſter and Genealogyes of David might have been ſearched, and there Ioſeph and Mary, and the babe in her womb, might have been found ut by Herod: but the wiſe and mercifull providence of God, hid this rom him,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65391:8"/> and he reſted himſelf ſatisfied in the deep plot he had excogitated, by occaſion of the wiſe men of the eaſt, of which hereafter. Yea God ſo over-ruled this taxation, that he hath made it an eminent confirmation of our Faith: for behold here a moſt illuſtrious proof that Jeſus Chriſt is of the houſe and line of the royal family of David: <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s act hath proved it, who thought of no ſuch thing. And ſhall I ſay it is probable that our two Scripture Genealogies in <hi>Matthew</hi> &amp; <hi>Luke,</hi> were taken out of Davids Genealogie, kept at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> the city of David? Where Herod might readily have found the right heir to Davids crown: But God hid it from his eyes. Again, by means of this taxation, Jeſus Chriſt was born at Bethlehem, according to the Scriptures <hi>Math.</hi> 2.5, 6. And <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s act was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled by God, to make this word to be accompliſhed. And laſtly, <hi>Caeſar</hi> cauſed Mary to be far from home, where ſhe was delivered, &amp; laid aſide out of all obſervation of her obſervers, touching the time of the birth of her firſt-born. And this is one of the forenamed Mantles, which the Lord drew over that Danger.</p>

               <p>They were men of great Faith, that could believe him to be King and Saviour, whom they found in ſo poor a Cottage, and in ſo poor a condition; but divine faith built upon Divine Teſtimony, can bear down all Objections of carnal and humane Reaſon, this faith of theſe ſtrangers was a ſtrengthening pattern to all believers, eſpecially to Joſeph and Mary, who were now in great danger. Herod having ſuch aſſured notice of the birth of Jeſus Chriſt at <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> What ever the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was, they attended upon the Lord, to obey all his Laws and Inſtitutions, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil them according to the Word. Therefore, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21 2. when eight dayes were accompliſhed, for circumciſing of the child, his Name was called Jeſus, which was ſo named of the Angel, before he was conceived in the Womb. Whether this ſervice was performed in the ſtable, where he was born, nothing is ſaid of it. but we may juſtly cenceive that ſome of the godly hearing of theſe eminent and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Teſtimonies, touching this child, had removed them to ſome fitter place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eight dayes were accompliſhed, and it may be, out of the City, if they were aware of the danger, that the child and his parents alſo were in. But where the Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There be yet two Laws more to be performed; for, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.39. they performed all things according to the Law. The two Laws remaining were the purification of Mary, and the dedication of the child unto God, which were te be performed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thirty three dayes more. Obedience to both theſe Laws they diligently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, both for time and place, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.22. and when the dayes of her purification according to the Law of Moſes were accompliſhed they brought him to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and preſented him to the Lord, as it is written in the Law of the Lord, <hi>every Male that openeth the Womb, ſhall be called holy to the Lord.</hi> And to offer a Sacrifice accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that which is ſaid in the Law of the Lord, <hi>a pair of Turtle doves, or two young pidgeons</hi> which is the poor womans offering, thus did they perform all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of the Lord.</p>
               <p>In this low condition of our Lord, &amp; in theſe black dark times, which were now at the dore, the Church did need ſtrong confirmations of Faith, to believe that this babe is the Meſſiah, the Saviour of the World, the King of Iſrael. Therefore the Lord did now provide two eminent and heavenly Teſtimonies by two eminent reverend and holy perſons, old Simeon, and old Anna, who were wrought by the Spirit at this time into the Temple, and there did give their publick Teſtimony touching this babe, that he is the Lord our Redeemer, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.25, <hi>ad</hi> 39. The firſt Teſtimony is given by old Simeon, whoſe perſon is deſcribed, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>behold there was a man in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>whoſe Name was Simeon, and the ſame man was juſt and devout, waiting for the conſolation of Iſrael, and the Holy Ghoſt was upon him.</hi> This holy man had a preparatory Revelation by the Holy Ghoſt, which is expreſſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghoſt, that he ſhould not ſee death, before he had ſeen the Lords Chriſt.

                  <hi>HErod</hi> knew himſelf to be an uſurper of the crown of David, and Kingdom of Judah: He knew that the Jews waited for a Redeemer, a king, a branch of the ſtock of David; and now he was eminently informed by the wiſe men of the eaſt, that the king of Judah, the right heir of the Kingdome of David was born, and that he was born at Bethlehem, therefore his politick wicked heart doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently plot and contrive how he may lay his bloudy hands upon him. He could not tell, nor could they inform him how long he had been born: therefore to make ſure of that, he craftily and privily called the wiſe men, and asked them how long it was ſince the ſtar firſt appeared to them? ſuppoſing he might be born at the firſt appearance of that ſtar. Therefore <hi>Math.</hi> 2.7. <hi>he privily called the Wiſe men and enquired of them di igently what time the Star appeared? who anſwered, that it had appeared to them two years.</hi> Math. 2.16. Thus hath he digged deep, and laid his plot ſo, that he would be ſure (as he thought) to find him out: Which being done, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.8. he ſent them to Bethlehem with this Order and appointment, <hi>Goe ſearch diligently for the young child, and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worſhip him alſo.</hi> What worſhip he intended to doe unto him,

It is not ſaid that they did make a promiſe ſo to doe, or that he required ſuch a promiſe of them, in policy he would not ſo doe, leſt they ſhould have ſmelt ſomething thereby. But they, when they had found the Child, worſhipped him, and made their offerings to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.12. <hi>being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God in a dream that they ſhould not return to Herod,</hi> (they being under no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement ſo to doe) they departed to their own Country another wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

How eaſily might Herod have found out both the Parents and the child, by ſearching Davids Genealogy, which <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Taxation had cauſed to be ſearched and made publick at Bethlehem. Or how eaſily might he have apprehended him, by laying wait for him in the Temple, when the child was publickly dedicated to God? But God hid theſe means and opportunityes from him, they came not into his heart, becauſe he reſted and confided, as carnal Politicians uſe to do, in his own deep &amp; cunningly contrived Stratagem.</p>
               <p>This likewiſe alſo was a wonderfull wiſdome of God, to delay Herod from ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in this matter, for about ſix weeks time, whereby opportunity was given to Joſeph and Mary to perform all that the law required: For it behoved Jeſus Chriſt to fulfill all righteouſneſs and perfectly to obſerve the law of God: and he did ſo. But this is to be obſerved alſo; how the active and paſſive obedience of Jeſus Chriſt are complicated together; and though theſe actions were the fulfilling of Ceremonial Laws, yet they were acts of moral obedience to the firſt and ſecond Commandments.</p>
               <p>When our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was publickly dedicated to God in the Temple, it is like thouſands of people were preſent, and thoſe famous Teſtimonies touching this Child by thoſe holy and reverend perſons Simeon and Anna rang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people and were greatly ſpoken off, and magnified, which would ſoon come to Herods Ear, either by his ſpyes, which Tyrants uſe to have abroad, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at ſuch publick Aſſemblies, or by the ſame thereof, that would ſound loud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people. This News would gaſter him. Now he preſently layes out to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that child, but behold &amp; admire how the wiſdom of God prevented him, that night, Math. 2.13, 14. <hi>behold an Angel of the Lord appeared in a dream, unto Joſeph ſaying, ariſe, take the young child and his Mother and flee into</hi> Egypt, <hi>and be thou there, until I bring thee word for Herod will ſeek the young child to deſtroy him, when he aroſe he took the young child, &amp; his mother by night &amp; departed into</hi> Egypt.

                  </gap>nt to ſeek for the child that was yeſterday dedicated to God, of whom ſuch divine Oracles were publickly delivered. But neither Parents nor Child could be found, no doubt he would ſend to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> &amp; all places thereabout, but they could not be found. Then would he ſend for the wiſe men of the Eaſt whom he had ſent unto <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and there they ſound tydings, that thoſe wiſe men had found a young child born in a ſtable, and laid in a manger, inſtead of a Cradle, that they worſhipped him, and offered gifts unto him, of gold, Frankincenſe and Myrrh, which when they had done, they departed home unto their own Country. When Herod heard this he ſwelled with rage extreamly, what have they mocked me thus? have they diſappointed me of my deſigne? we may well conceive that all theſe diſappointments in a matter of ſo great importance, would blow up the Tyrant
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65391:10"/> into an horrible rage. Carnal Polititians have ſeldome patience to bear ſuch diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments; now his cruel heart would put him upon his firſt conceived plot, when he privily enquired how long the Star had appeared in the Eaſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.16. then He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod when he ſaw that he was mocked of the wiſe men, was exceeding wroth, and ſent forth, and ſlew all the Children that were in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and in all the Coal's thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently enquired of the wiſe men, this ſheweth, he ſtayed not long before he fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this perſecution. The lamentation which this cruel ſlaughter raiſed, is beſt ſet forth by the Scripture, <hi>Mathew</hi> ſhewing that it was a fulfilling of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy long ago written by Jeremiah. <hi>Math,</hi> 2.17, 18. Then was fulfilled that which was ſpoken by Jeremy the Prophet, ſaying, <hi>in</hi> Ramah <hi>was there a voice heard, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and weeping, and great mourning,</hi> Rachel <hi>weeping for her Children, and would not be comforted, becauſe they were not.</hi> How many hundreds if not thouſands of theſe Innocent babes were martyred for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, in that populous and prolifick Nation, we cannot tell, but we ſhall know at the day of Judgement when all theſe things ſhall be opened and judged by our Lord Jeſus, who was thus cruelly perſecuted by Herod, it was Jeſus Chriſt that they ſtruck at, though the blow miſſed him, and fell upon theſe innocent babes. This flight of Joſeph and Mary, and the Child Jeſus into <hi>Egypt,</hi> is to be numbred among the great ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, and was occaſioned by a ſore and bloody perſecution, he fled for his life, when he fled from under Herods Jurisdiction he was forced to fly from the Communion of the Church, from the Temple and publick worſhip of God, which his Father David had experienced to be a very black cloud, a bitter diſtreſs, he fled to <hi>Egypt</hi> the place of Iſraels bondage, ſorrow, and affliction. Lo now Iſrael is in <hi>Egypt</hi> again, he is an exile from the Church, and fled into the world to ſave his life. in this ſad place and caſe he lived, even ſo long as Herod lived after the birth of Jeſus Chriſt which was about two years, all which time Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered in his perſon, and he ſuffered in his Saints, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.9. <hi>in all their afflictions he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,</hi> when the innocent Infants were martyred for his ſake, he ſuffered with them when their Parents lamented, when Rachel mourned, &amp; would not be comforted, he ſuffered with them, when his Parents Joſeph and Mary fled under the terrour of Herods perſecution for their lives, he ſuffered with them, and not only in their flight, but alſo in all the ſufferings that followed he ſuffered with them.

And as his life was the pretious life of a publick perſon, ſo all his ſufferings were the ſufferings of a publick perſon, the Redeemer of Gods Elect.</p>
               <p>And this is to be noted, that in all his ſufferings, he did attend unto, follow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Counſel. he did not raſhly, or without cauſe or call, either expoſe himſelf to danger, or engage into any difficulties, alwayes he attended unto the command, and direction of the Lord, whatever the Lord appointed to him, that he did, and ſuffered, in all which he is an holy pattern unto us in all our ſufferings.

What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion had they for their ſuſtenance? In this matter Gods eminent providential care over them appeared: for the wiſe men of the eaſt offered gold, frankincenſe and myrrh, which were worth gold in Egypt. And hereby the Lord made a ſupply of proviſion for their ſubſiſtence, to bear all their charges, in this difficult and chargeable flight. O what a ſovereign high hand of God is here magnified, to provide and ſend men from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> among other ends, to bring ſuſtenance and proviſion for Joſeph, Mary and Jeſus in their flight into <hi>Egypt!</hi> This perſecution that Herod raiſed againſt Jeſus Chriſt in his Infancy, was the firſt entertainment that he had among the Jews, and it was very ſharp, but reached not his life, he had other things to do and accompliſh in this world, before he left it. We read of no more perſecutions that he ſuffered, until he entered his publick Miniſtry, and then the chief Prieſts, Scribes, and Phariſees, hypocrites were his perſecutors, and they did ſo malitiouſly, cunningly, and effectually follow the matter, that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted him to the death; under their hands he finiſhed his ſufferings in this life, which he came into the world to undergoe.</p>

Behold here this child John, was the moſt famous child (of a meer man) that ever was brought forth into the world. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, he was not comparable to the child Jeſus, as may be made to appear in many and great reſpects; yea in thoſe two things that are ſaid of John in the ſame words wherein they are ſaid of Jeſus, <hi>viz. that he grew and waxed ſtrong in ſpirit,</hi> there is a wonderfull difference betwixt John and Jeſus,</p>
               <p n="1">1. John was a Son of fallen man, under the ſtain of Original Sin, though he was very early ſanctified, even in the womb, three months before he was born: yet by nature he was defiled and ſtained with Original Sin, by reaſon of the juſt imputation of the guilt of Adams ſin unto him: for thus ſin is propagated from Father to child, all the poſterity of Adam being in his loins. The Embrio in the womb is not a Man, till it be quickned with an immortal Soul: though it hath principles of natural growth, yet till it be united and quickned with an immortal Soul, it is not Man kind, and the Law taketh no hold on it. And that the body is thus prepared in the womb, before the immortal Soul is creatingly infuſed into it, and united; doth appear, (as I conceive) in that law of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.22, 23. <hi>If a man ſtrive, and hurt a woman with child, ſo that her fruit depart from her, and yet no miſchi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if it were quickned, it is murder, and life muſt goe for life. So ſoon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the conception is quickned with an immortal Soul, it is a man, a Son of Adam, and now the Law taketh hold on him, vindictive juſtice doth judge him guilty of Adams ſin, becauſe he was in Adams loins. Thus is ſin propagated, and puniſhment inflicted, he is puniſhed with Original ſin by the juſtice of the law.</p>

Adam was created under the Law as a rule of life, but vindictive juſtice had nothing to ſay unto him, untill he had ſinned; but ſo ſoon as he had ſinned, then the Law condemned him, and puniſhed him.

               <p n="3">3. John was but a man, a meer man, as other of mankind be, but Jeſus Chriſt was God and man in one perſon. The ſecond perſon in Trinity did aſſume this holy thing, this humane nature, this pure ſpotleſs thing, and made it one perſon with himſelf, a Myſtery eternally to be admired, and herein Jeſus did infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell John.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The humane nature of Jeſus had the Image of God in him in all perfection, whereby he was able to keep the Law of God, under which he was made purely, perfectly and meritoriouſly. And that, not only as Adam was able to do at his firſt Creation, but infinitely more excellently, becauſe he is God-man. But it was far otherwiſe with John, for he had Gods Image but in part, even ſo much as Jeſus Chriſt by his Spirit through free grace ſaw meet to diſpence unto him, which though it was in greater meaſure then other men, or Prophets, yet infinitely ſhort of Jeſus Chriſt, and he kept the Law according to the meaſure of grace and aſſiſtance which he received from Ieſus Chriſt, and he needed a pardon from Ieſus Chriſt, of his infirmityes and failings in his obedience; and therefore Iohn doth juſtly diminiſh himſelf in reſpect of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 3.11. <hi>whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to bear,</hi> Mark. 1.7. <hi>whoſe ſhooe-ſtrings I am not worthy to unty.</hi>

There is great difference of Souls, though we ſee and know the increaſe of the Body, but know not the wiſdom and power of God how he doth perform it, ſo we are much more ignorant how the Lord performeth the growth of Souls, and how the Soul is adapted &amp; fitted to the body, &amp; that in every part, and unto every purpoſe; It is alſo wonderful to obſerve the different bigneſs of Souls with the adapting of the body for the Soul, it is better to ſay, the body is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Soul, then to ſay the Soul is fitted for the body, though both be true. Gluttons and drunkards, and unclean perſons, and lazy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do ſpoyle their bodies and unfit them for their Souls uſe, it is a point of great wiſdom to govern and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the body for the uſe and ſervice of the Soul. Again, we may obſerve great likeneſs and unlikeneſs of bodyes and Souls, which cometh to paſs by a wonderful and powerful operation of Gods wiſdom, the foundation whereof is laid in the firſt matter of the body, and ſo in the created matter of the Soul, bodily port, comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, features, geſtures, diſpoſitions, inclinations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are patronimick gifts and effects.

I might here digreſs into the conſideration of the admirable wiſdome of God in the preparation of this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſon to be a ſpotleſs Lamb, a fit Sacrifice for ſin, offered to God for the ſin of man. The life of this perſon was more precious then any other of mankind; yea more precious then all the lives of all mankind.

                     </gap>tifie you throughout in body, Soul, and Spirit,</hi> that which is called the Spirit of a man is chiefly (as I conceive) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, becauſe conſcience conſtraineth us to action, and judgeth of our action when it is done, by carrying it to the Rule, and glaſs, which is Gods Candle, a wounded Spirit mentioned. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. is a wounded Conſcience. Zeal is acted partly in Conſcience, which exerteth action, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.17. <hi>the zeal of thy houſe hath ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten me up.</hi> This zealous Spirit maketh a man devout to God in all dutyes of the firſt Table, juſt, loving, and benificent to man in all duties of the ſecond Table.</p>
               <p>Conſcience is called the ſpirit of a man, becauſe it is one chief ſeat in a man, where the ruling ſpirit of a man, ſitteth, abideth and acteth. The ſpirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the whole man, in every faculty, eſpecially in the Will, Conſcience, and Vnderſtanding. All mankind are ſecretly acted by a ſpirit, either good or bad: the carnal ſort are acted by the Devils ſpirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. <hi>the ſpirit that acteth in the Children of Diſobedience.</hi> Thus it is ordinarily, though Gods Spirit may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times break in. yea effectually in ſuch as ſhall be ſaved. But the Godly are acted by the good Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11, 13, 14. <hi>if the Spirit dwel in you, he ſhall quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you. And if through the Spirit, ye mortifie the deeds of the fleſh. and as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the ſons of God.</hi> One chief ſeat or reſidence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, is the Conſcience, where he ſitteth and overlooketh the underſtanding the will, the affections, the paſſions, and all the figments and imaginations. And hence Conſcience chiefly raiſeth the ſpiritual War, and ſets all grace into action againſt all ſin. The evil Spirit that ruleth in the carnal, hath his chief ſeat in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginations, figments, affections and Luſts; and the ſmoak of them blindeth the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65391:16"/> underſtanding, yea and conſcience too; perverteth the will, and all the powers o the ſoul, and inclineth them to evil continually: and by thoſe doors he creepeth in, yea, ſometimes breaketh into the hearts of the godly. Thus we ſee why Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may be called the Spirit of a man, and ſo the Spirit of Ieſus, and of Iohn, may be their Conſcience in a good part.</p>
               <p>Q. 2. What is it to be ſtrong in ſpirit? <hi>A.</hi> To be full of Grace, Zeal and Courage for God: ſo Jeſus Chriſt was, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.17. when he was eaten up with Zeal, for the purity of Gods houſe and inſtituted Worſhip. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.10.

And when they had fulfilled the dayes, as they returned, the child Jeſus tarried behind in Ieruſalem, and Joſeph and his Mother knew not of it. But they ſuppoſing him to have been in the company, went a dayes journey, and they ſought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. And when they found him not, they turned back again to Ieruſalem, ſeeking him. And it came to paſs, that after three dayes, they found him in the temple, ſitting in the midſt of the Doctors, both hearing them, and asking them Questions.

No doubt this holy child Jeſus did in his child-hood utter many gracious words, and did many gracious actions; but it hath pleaſed God to record only this one, for the uſe of the Church in this world, and hath covered all the reſt with the mantle of ſilence.

It was not ſo with Jeſus; for when he might have been gone with his parents, when they went away after the worſhip was finiſhed, yet he ſtayed behind them. And where ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he? not in any common place or vain company, nor in any vain ſports and pleaſures, but he ſtayed in the temple, he went to the place of the education of youth, into the Schools of inſtruction of youth. A rare example for a child ſo to doe. Too many of our youth will ſtay behind their parents, and will not goe home in their company: but what ſtay they about? for no good, but for ſport and pleaſure: and where ſtay they? ſometimes in common places, ſometimes in profane places, in taverns, or other places where profane perſons reſort, where they may ſerve their pleaſures and luſts, wherein they take more delight then in the ſervice of God. O youth, youth, learn of this holy child Jeſus, if you ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind your Parents, or if you go not home to your Parents, let your tarryance be in the Temple, or in ſome ſervice of God, or where you may do or receive ſome good!</p>

Here ſee his Parents vigilant, diligent, and ſolicitous care of their Child when they miſſed him in their company, they went on the firſt dayes journy hoping that he was in the company of ſome of their kindred, or neighbours, and acquaintance, for they knew that he was civil, ſociable and courteous; but at night, at that firſt dayes journeys end, they ſearched for him, inquired of all the Company, they could hear no tidings of him, none of them had ſeen him any where in the way. Now are they filled with ſorrow, no quiet reſt could they take that night, up they riſe in the morning, back again they go, enquiring of all they meet, ſeeking every where for him, but no tydings could they hear of him. That night they got back to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſtill can hear no tydings of him: the longer they ſeek, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their ſorrows, and leſs reſt could they take that night, a good pattern to all Parents diligently to look after their Children, when they are miſſing, and a great blame it is to ſuch Parents as ſuffer their Children to go and come, whether and when they will.</p>

But God had wiſe and holy ends in ordering and over-ruling their motions to be as they were: when they came to the Temple they ſoon found him there, the Temple was his Fathers houſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.16. and what place could they ſeek to find the Son in, more likely then in his Fathers houſe? there they find him. And what employment did they find him about, in his Fathers houſe? They found him in the place of Education and Inſtruction of youth, in the knowledge of the Scriptures and Religion, a very meet place &amp; employment for a godly religious wiſe child, and an eminent example to all youth, to go of his own accord unto the Schools, where he might learn Inſtruction in the knowledge of God and of the Scriptures. It is far otherwiſe with too many of our youth, who when they are miſſing, muſt be ſought for in Taverns, Ordinaryes, or ſuch like places of ſin, vanity, and profaneneſs.</p>

When it was his turn in order to anſwer to the queſtion propoſed, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the queſtion with ſuch underſtanding as made them to admire, that word <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.26. was verified in him, <hi>every man ſhall kiſs his lips, that giveth a right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi> and Prov. 20.15. <hi>the lips of knowledge are pretious jewels,</hi> and Prov. 15.23. <hi>a man hath joy by the anſwer of his mouth, and a word ſpoken in due ſeaſon how good is it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When it was his turn to ask and propound queſtions, he did propound ſuch queſtions as did amaze them.

Good Children will refuſe vain company, vanities and play, to keep company with their godly parents. Godly youth will chiefly prize and rather chuſe the deſirable company of their good parents, as being according to the commandment of God, and the holy pattern that our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt hath ſet us. Once we ſee that he tarried behind them; but we alſo ſee what a good Apology he had for it; becauſe he was about his heavenly Fathers buſineſs. according to this inſtance was his, and his Parents practiſe all his dayes. From this time forward for eighteen years did they thus walk. Order is comely in Gods eyes, and becometh Gods Houſe and Worſhip: in ſuch order did they conſtantly walk with God. Hereby Jeſus Chriſt did fullfill perfectly all the laws of God, touching his orderly attendance unto the inſtituted worſhip of God.

And that Jeſus did read the Scriptures, there is no doubt to be made of it, becauſe he hath commanded us to ſearch the Scriptures; wherein he was ſo expert, that <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.27. <hi>beginning at Moſes and all the Prophets, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himſelf.</hi> That Jeſus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated and prayed, which are two exerciſes of the Soul, ſo neer of kind, that they are ſeldome aſunder: eſpecially when we meditate on Religion &amp; the Scriptures And how abundant our Lord Jeſus was in prayer, is greatly witneſſed in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels. Thus Jeſus Chriſt hath ſet a pattern to all ſcholars and Chriſtians, who all are the Scholars of Jeſus, how we may increaſe in wiſdome. Wiſdome entereth into the Soul by degrees, ſo it entered into the ſoul of Jeſus, becauſe he increaſed in wiſdome.

Though the carnal perſecuting world, vexed and incenſed by his holineſs and faithful miniſtry, were blinded with the black ſmoak of envy, and his perſon obſcured by poverty and a low condition, and therefore ſaw no beauty, nor any thing deſireable in him; yet in Gods eye he was his pleaſant Child, and in the Churches eye he was a glorious perſon, <hi>we beheld his glory, the glory of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and Truth,</hi> Joh. 1.14.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>He increaſed in favour both wi h God and man,</hi> he was a very gracious, holy youth, a young man eminent in Religion, eminent in Sabbath worſhip, in Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue worſhip, in Family worſhip, in Temple worſhip, all his converſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was holy, heavenly, and religious; he behaved himſelf in all things as a darling Child of God.

               <head type="sub">The Hiſtory of ſome of the Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt which he lay under and indured through all the courſe of his Humane life in this world, many of them in this moſt quiet time of his life before he entered upon his publick Miniſtry</head>
               <p>MY ſcope being to explain and ſet forth the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, I ſhall endeavour according to my poor ability, to ſhew what ſufferings Jeſus Chriſt underwent in all this courſe of his pilgrimage. Jeſus Chriſt having undertaken to be our Advocate with the Father, and to procure our peace with God; as it was incumbent on him to purchaſe for us the Inheritance promiſed in the Covenant of works, by fulfilling the Law by his pure, perfect, and meritorious, active obedience unto the Law of God, which Adam left unperformed. So it was incumbent upon our Lord Jeſus to ſuffer the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due unto us, for our tranſgreſſion of the Law. <hi>The Captain of our Salvation muſt be made perfect by ſuffering.</hi> Hence when in his Infancy he fled for his life, from Herods Jurisdiction into <hi>Egypt,</hi> this ſuffering of Chriſt was a part of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due unto the ſin of man, he having taken upon him the imputation of the guilt of the ſin of man. The curſe and puniſhment due to ſin did juſtly fall upon him, and under that conſideration were all the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, he did not ſuffer affliction as a means of mortification of ſin, as we do, for he had no ſin to mortifie, but all that he ſuffered was by virtue of his office of a Mediator, and he ſuffered in all things the puniſhment due to ſin, his ſufferings were all of them a branch of the curſe, an effect of the guilt of ſin, he ſuffered in all things as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick perſon, as a Mediator, and therefore in every thing that he ſuffered he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went the wrath of God, the curſe and puniſhment of the Law, which was due to ſin, never did a man ſuffer ſuch ſufferings, and ſo, as Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered. When he returned from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and his Parents by prudent fear were conſtrained to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw into an obſcure corner of the Country, there to hide, and bring up the child, Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered this as an effect of the guilt of the ſin of man, as a branch of the curſe and wrathful puniſhment of the ſin of man; and this obſcurity did run through his whole life. More particularly, I ſhall inſtance ſome of the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt which he ſuffered all his life long, even in this moſt quiet time of his life, when his active obedience did chiefly ſhine, and this I do to ſhew the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his active obedience and paſſive obedience together in his quieteſt and beſt times, wherein he did moſt illuſtriouſly perform his active obedience, he was under clouds of ſuffering in them all. And firſt I ſhall lay ſundry of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then open them diſtinctly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered for us the affliction of poverty as it is a fruit of the curſe, the ſting of the guilt of ſin, wrath and puniſhment of ſin were in it.</p>

               <p>But they fell upon Jeſus Chriſt as puniſhments of ſin, fruits of the curſe, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon our Surety to the uttermoſt of the merit and deſert of ſin, until vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive juſtice was ſatisfied, and ſaid, I am well pleaſed, it is enough.

               <p>I ſhall more particularly open theſe ſeveral ſorts of puniſhments of ſins which our Lord Jeſus ſuffered for us, to ſatisfie Divine juſtice, and to take away the ſting and curſe of them from us, and to ſanctifie them to be wholſome medicines in his hand to do us good by them.</p>

He was the Son of a Carpenter. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.55. and wrought with his Father for his living, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.3. yet had not the means or opportunity to raiſe any worldly eſtate, nor to build for himſelf an houſe, nor any ſhelter where to lay his head, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.2. <hi>he grew as a Root out of a dry ground,</hi> and men know that ſuch Roots grow but poorly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.17. <hi>but I am poor and nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and this is manifeſtly ſpoken of Chriſt, as appeareth, <hi>ver,</hi> 6, 7, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſame is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 70.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.29. <hi>I am poor and ſorrowful,</hi> and this Pſalm ſpeaketh
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65391:22"/> abundantly of the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, and this of poverty is one of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.22. <hi>I am poor and needy,</hi> and this Pſalm is a Propheſy of Jeſus Chriſt, his Parents were poor which appeareth by their lodging in a Stable, and at his mothers purification, they offered the poor womans offering, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. This part of the ſufferings of Chriſt is abundantly declared both in the Propheſy and alſo in the Hiſtory. Poverty is not a ſin, but an affliction a puniſhment of ſin, ſin hath brought poverty upon man, as the deſert of our ſin, man was a rich Lord, but ſin hath made him a poor beggar. The reaſon why poverty is a puniſhment, is, becauſe it cutteth us off, and depriveth us, and taketh away much of our domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the Creatures of God. Adam was made Lord over Gods Creatures, in this low world he had dominion over them, but ſin hath ſtripped us in a great meaſure of our dominion. God will permit us to have a little, a few of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to rule over and employ. Though ſome dominion over, and uſe of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures God doth allow to every one, even to the pooreſt Lazarus, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earth to tred and ly upon, the Air to breath in, and ſome food to live upon, though this is a grant of free mercy, for ſin hath deſerved that we ſhould be ſtripped of all good.</p>
                  <p>Poverty is a very dark cloud drawn over ſinful man, which vaileth all his glory and humane excellency. And it was a dark cloud over Jeſus Chriſt, when he was here on Earth amongſt us. There be many vices that attend Poverty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.4. but Jeſus Chriſt touched none of them, he ſuffered ſinleſs poverty, but not the ſins of poverty which it tempteth and expoſeth men unto; there be alſo many virtues that attend and ſhine in poverty, theſe virtues did Jeſus Chriſt ſhine in, there is ſanctified poverty and that Chriſt ſuffered, there is alſo unſanctified poverty, and that Jeſus Chriſt touched not; he ſuffered the curſe of poverty, that he might take the curſe out of it; this he ſuffered, to turn the quality, the effect and the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to be only medicinal, and not deſtructive unto us. Conſider what be the afflictions of poverty which Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered, and then ſee how Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered them all, yea, more then I can utter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Poverty cutteth off, depriveth, bereaveth us of thoſe creatures of God over which we are to have dominion in this low world, for our comfort and uſe. God made man Lord over the works of his hand, gave him wiſdome to uſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them to the glory and ſervice of God, and for his own honour and comfort. but ſin hath ſtripped us of this our dominion; we have forfeited and loſt all, ſee a bereaved condition deſcribed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.38, <hi>to</hi> 46. <hi>thou haſt caſt off and abhorred, thou haſt been wroth with thy anointed, thou haſt prophaned his crown, by caſting it to the ground thou haſt broken down all his hedges, thou haſt made his glory to ceaſe, and caſt his throne to the ground.</hi> alas, how poor hath ſin left man! Adam ſuffered the greateſt loſs &amp; down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall that ever man ſuffered! poor Adam! he loſt the Lordſhip of the whole world, both from his own poſſeſſion, and his Childrens after him. Only God did of his meer bounty and goodneſs reſtore unto him a little under the government of Chriſt, ſo much as might ſerve his turn in a poor manner, to paſs through the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage of man in this world. By this fall of Adam, and loſs of his dominion, the Devil hath got it in a great meaſure by the permiſſion of our Lord, into his hand, and all his ſtudy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and care, is to bring all dominion, riches, and worldly honour into the hands of the wicked and ungodly world; who will be real and vigorous promoters of his affairs and Kingdome.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond affliction of poverty is; he hath but little, and that but mean food, little and poor raiment, little, or no houſe, ſhelter or harbour of his own, no beaſt to ride on, to eaſe him in his travails, or to bear burthens for him. So it was with Jeſus Chriſt, poor food, which appeareth by this, that his miraculous feeding the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65391:22"/> people with that food which was provided for themſelves, and that was barly bread and fiſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.6.13. <hi>there is a lad here that hath five barly loaves, and two ſmall fiſhes,</hi> ve. 13. <hi>they gathered and filled twelve baskets full with the fragments of the five barley loaves,</hi> for garments we read little, but he exhorted his Diſciples to have but one Coat, and it is moſt probable that he had no more himſelf. For houſe and harbour, the Text ſaith, he had none of his own, though he had built for others. For beaſts, he had not ſo much as a poor Aſs to ride on, and when he came triumphant into the City, he borrowad an Aſs to ride on, <hi>Math.</hi> 21.2, 3. alas poor Kiing! how would his unbelieving adverſaries deride him! none of the Kings and great ones regarded him, nor yet the people, only believers had faith to behold him that was behind this Curtain of poverty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third affliction of poverty, the poor are neglected, diſregarded, yea, though they be wiſe; benificent, and do eminent good works, poverty ſo darkens them, that they are forgotten and not regarded, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.14, 15, 16. <hi>thare was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle City, and few men within it, and there came a great King againſt it, and beſieged it, and built great bulwarks againſt it, now there was found in it a poor wiſe man, and he by his wiſdome delivered the City, yet no man remembred that poor man, then I ſaid, wiſdome is better then ſtrength,</hi> nevertheleſs, <hi>the poor mans wiſdome is deſpiſed, and his words are not heard,</hi> So it was with Jeſus, he was very wiſe, full of wiſdome from a child, <hi>Luk,</hi> 2.40. and in his courſe of life, no doubt did give much good counſel unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and did many notable and eminent good works, but by reaſon of his poverty none regarded him. And that may be one Reaſon why ſo little is recorded of him in the time of his private life. Yea, he hath not only delivered a City, but a world, not from an earthly King, but from the vindictive juſtice of God, and not only their bodies, but their Souls alſo, and yet who was more neglected then Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.3. <hi>he is deſpiſed and rejected of men,</hi> though he was employed in the great work of our Salvation, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.23. <hi>I am poor and lightly eſteemed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth affliction of poverty; if the poor do never ſo little anger, vex, or ſtand in the light of the proud, carnal world, they will deſpiſe and curſe them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.48, 49. have any of the Rulers and Phariſees believed in him? but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who know not the Law are curſed, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.28.34. <hi>they reviled him, they ſaid, thou wert altogether born in ſin, and doſt thou teach us! and they caſt him out,</hi> Prov. 14.20. <hi>the poor is hated even of his own neighbour, but the rich hath many friends,</hi> Prov. 19.4. <hi>wealth maketh many friends, but the poor is ſeparated from his Neighbour,</hi> Prov. 19.7. <hi>all the brethren of the poor do hate him, how much more do his friends go far from him, he purſueth them with words, yet they are wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ing to him.</hi> Thus it was with Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.5. <hi>for neither did his brethren believe in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth affliction of poverty is, when a man is poor, men think that God deſpiſeth them, as they themſelves do. Thus they dealt by Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.4. <hi>we did eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God and afflicted,</hi> Ier. 5.4. <hi>poor and fooliſh,</hi> poverty renders a man deſtitute, forlorn &amp; deſpicable, poverty layeth a man by like a broken potſheard good for nothing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.15. <hi>the deſtruction of the poor is his poverty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſixth affliction of poverty is, every one will be bold to afflict, wrong, tread upon the poor man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.2, 8, 6, 14. <hi>the wicked in his pride doth perſecute the poor. his eyes are fiercely ſet againſt the poor, he catcheth the poor when he draweth him into his net,</hi> men are bold to injure the poor, becauſe they know they are not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge themſelves, and they think no body elſe will, they think not of God that he hath taken the protection of the poor, and that he will behold their miſchief, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65391:23"/> ſpight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.14. <hi>thou haſt ſeen it, for thou beholdeſt miſchief and ſpight to require it, with thy hand, the poor committeth himſelf to thee, thou art the helper of the Fatherleſs,</hi> Am. 2 6. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord for three Tranſgreſſions of Iſrael and for four I will not turn away the puniſhment thereof, becauſe they ſold the righteous for ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus it was with Ieſus Chriſt, his poverty did diſable him from carrying any breadth among men. Yet Jeſus Chriſt by his divine power did many wonderful and miraculous good works, in healing all manner of diſeaſes, in feeding the hungry in a time of need, he entertained and fed many thouſands at one time, and that in a wilderneſs, he filled all their bellies, and no doubt all their pockets, bags, or baskets, and when all had taken what they would, they ſtill left many baskets full. No Prince on Earth did, or could make ſuch a bountiful Feaſt, his poverty is no hindrance to his divine power from doing ſuch acts of noble libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; and ſo it was with the Apoſtles afterward, though they were poor, yet that hindred not them from doing great acts of beneficence to men, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.6. <hi>ſilver and gold have I none, but ſuch as I have give I thee, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt of Nazaret, riſe up and walk.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.10. <hi>as poor, yet making many rich,</hi> and that with the beſt, and moſt true riches in the world. <hi>rich in Faith,</hi> though poor in this world, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.5.</p>

For the ſatisfaction of the vindictive juſtice of God for the ſin of man, all ſinleſs puniſhment which ſin had deſerved, and juſtly brought upon man, this Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered, of which puniſhment poverty is a chief part. Adam was a rich Lord over the world, he had a great dominion, but upon his fall he was thruſt out of Paradice, ſtripped of all his dominion, dignity, and glory, he was Lord of the world, but now an outcaſt, a poor beggar, he has nothing but what Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will beſtow on him, he hangs upon every creature for relief, wool, hair, hides, fleſh, and many other things he is neceſſitated to get from the creatures of God, for his relief, which are drops and branches of his loſt dominion, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this beggarly condition of man, ſo fooliſh many are, to bedeck themſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lves in pride with theſe things which ſhould be for their humbling. This ſecond ſtate of Adam, this poor puniſhed condition did Ieſus Chriſt take upon him, <hi>Phil,</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>though equal with God,</hi> yet he became a ſtripped, bereaved, naked man, and of the pooreſt ſort among them. This was a chief part of the ſufferings of Ieſus Chriſt for the ſin of man, he bore this effect of Gods wrath upon fallen man, to bear it off and away from us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Ieſus Chriſt bore this part of the puniſhment of ſin, for the ſake of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, to ſanctifie this ſtate of poverty for them, to take out the ſting of it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the curſe from it that it might become a bleſſing to them; for it is Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne and purpoſe, that the ſtate of his Church and Saints in this world ſhould be

                  <p n="3">3. Jeſus Chriſt came into the world in this poor condition, to leave an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to Satan to tempt and prevail with the wicked Jews and Romans, to put him to death, for none of them feared to abuſe ſuch a poor man, Herod and his men of War deſpiſed him, the Emperour and other Rulers under him feared him not but eaſily condeſcended and conſpired to put him to cruel ſufferings and death; he was ſo darkened by the cloud of poverty, that he had no thoughts that he was th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Moreover it is neceſſary to conſider that the poverty of Jeſus was a thouſand times, yea, above all compariſon, more bitter then our poverty is, for his poverty had the ſting of the curſe in it, it was an effect of the wrath of God. And by his ſuffering thereof, unto the full ſatisfaction of divine juſtice: he took the ſting of the curſe out of our ſufferings, and out of our poverty, and made them to be only medicinal to us. Our poverty and all our ſufferings are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many accounts ſweet and eaſy, yea Jeſus Commands us to rejoyce, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad under them. <hi>The believing Jews took joyfully the ſpoyling of their goods,</hi> Heb. 10.34. But Jeſus Chriſt his ſufferings were all bitter, as reſpecting his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, as being our Mediator and Surety</p>
                  <p>He had joy in reſpect of the Father whoſe will he obeyed and fulfilled, but the deſert and puniſhment of their ſin lay with its full weight upon him, ſo that we ſee, that the poverty of Jeſus Chriſt was an heavy part of his ſufferings, a part of his paſſive obedicnce, which did run through the whole courſe of his life, from his birrh to his death.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When a man is unfit for any action or ſervice in his generation, like an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage finely carved, but good for nothing, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.10. But Jeſus Chriſt was not ſuch an one, he did the greateſt good to man thar ever was done, never man did the like, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.6. <hi>who in the heavens can be compared to the Lord, who among the Sons of the mighty can be likened to the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When men are deboſhed and defiled with groſs ſins, this doth debaſe them, and make them no bodies, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.34. But Jeſus Chriſt was far from any ſuch ſtain or ſpot, <hi>he is a Lamb without ſpot or blemiſh,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19. <hi>he knew no ſin, though he was made ſin for us,</hi> by the imputation of our ſin, and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.32, 23, 24. <hi>who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth, who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly; who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the Tree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Men are rendred of no eſteem, when they are of an ill diſpoſition, proud, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, ſelfiſh, paſſionate, cenſorious, contentious, and ſuch like. But no ſuch thing was ever found in Jeſus Chriſt, he was <hi>meek, lowly, lovely Math.</hi> 11.29. <hi>learn of me for I am meek and lowly,</hi> Math 12.17, 18, 20. <hi>he ſhall not ſtrive nor cry,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, When men are poor in the world, this makes them low and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable in the worlds Eye. And this only was the caſe of Ieſus Chriſt, ſaving that we may add, that his holineſs of Doctrine and life would be, yea, was an Eye-ſore to the Scribes, Phariſees, and hipocrites, and to ſuch as adhered unto them. This low condition is a part of the ſpotleſs puniſhment of the ſin of man, unto which Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt doth voluntarily ſubmit himſelf.</p>

                  <p>Yet take this with theſe cautious, 1.

Jeſus Chriſt came in a low condition in this world, and carryeth his Elect (many of them) through this world in a low condition, to exert and exerciſe Gods Sovereignty, in defending his poor worms againſt the proud great world, and ſometimes in advancing his worm, Jacob and David from the Shephards crook to the Scepter, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.48. <hi>he hath regarded the low eſtate of his handmaid,</hi> this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of God is highly celebrated, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.4. <hi>ad</hi> 11. <hi>Job.</hi> 5.15, 16. and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly in the books both of the Scriptures and of the providences of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="2">2. He had no need to be a Servant under tuition, to teach him humility and ſubjection, he needed not to be taught by any humane yoke. We need it, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.27 <hi>It is good for us to bear the Yoke of Tuition in our Youth.</hi> but it was not ſo with Ieſus Chriſt his heavenly Fathers will and command were enough for him, who had the perfect Image of God, and without the leaſt ſtain of original ſin.</p>

Becauſe theſe three kinds of Service that he did undergo, were enough to ſanctifie all kinds and degrees of ſervice, for us who need the tuition of ſuch a yoke, becauſe our nature is ſtained with original ſin, and needeth to be ſubdued and tamed, and thereby be made capable of Inſtruction.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Ieſus Chriſt took the form of a Servant to ſatisfie Divine juſtice in ſubmitting himſelf to bear the puniſhment due to the ſin of man. Sin ſtripped man of his dignity, dominion, Lordſhip and Rule, and caſt him into a ſtate of ſervitude, the ſting &amp; curſe of this puniſhment Chriſt ſuffered purely perfectly, and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, to the full ſatisfaction of divine juſtice, &amp; thereby hath took out the ſting &amp; curſe of ſervitude, he bore that in his own perſon, to bear it off, and heave it away from us. This is one part of his paſſive obedience to bear the puniſhment of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, this is one part of his paſſive obedience which did run through the whole courſe of his life, and eſpecially in the whole courſe of his private life, for it was otherwiſe in ſome reſpects in the time of his publick Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe hereby he ſanctified the ſtate of Service for us, that it might be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal and wholſome for us, to humble us, ſanctifie us and do us good. The curſe being removed, it is become a Goſpel rod, and a yoke which we have need of, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in our youth, and Ieſus Chriſt hath fitted it to do us good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Ieſus Chriſt took the form of a ſervant, that he might perform that active o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Law of God, which that order doth owe unto the Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by merit that reward, that part of the Inheritance which was by the covenant of works, due unto the perfect obſervation of thoſe Laws. And this merit of Ieſus Chriſt is imputed to us that believe, by the covenant of grace. So that by taking the form of a ſervant Ieſus Chriſt performed both active &amp; paſſive obedience to God, the fruit whereof is made ours by the Goſpel. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt did fulfil all righteouſneſs.</hi> Mat. 3.15. wherof this is no ſmall part, in his obedience to the fifth commandment.</p>

                  <p>THe forenamed Inſtances of the Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt did manifeſtly run through the whole courſe of his life, all the time of his youth, which were ſo farr as we know, his moſt ſerene dayes that he lived in this world, &amp; wherein he attended to his active obedience to the Law of God, yet he was alwayes in a dark, obſcure, low, ſuffering condition.</p>
                  <p>The Inſtances of his ſufferings which follow, are more conſpicuous in the courſe of his publick Miniſtry, ſuch was this point, in this Section touched on, <hi>viz. his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Infirmityes,</hi> mentioned by Mathew, which words are recited out of <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.4. <hi>ſurely he hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows,</hi> and this Text he bringeth to prove <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt did heal all manner of diſeaſes, and ſickneſſes,</hi> not as a Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, but as a Mediator, by divine power and Authority, as God and man. He did bear all the ſinleſs puniſhment of our ſins in his body, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. <hi>himſelf bare our ſins in his own body,</hi> that is the puniſhment of our ſins, <hi>viz.</hi> ſinleſs puniſhment, whereof our bodily infirmityes, weakneſſes, pains and ſickneſſes are a great and eminent part. And by this part of his ſufferings he (ſo far) ſatisfied divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and thereby hath taken out the ſting and curſe out of our bodily infirmityes, and hath rendred them only medicinal to our Souls, and hereby he hath obtained power over all diſeaſes, to ſend them, and to recall them as he pleaſeth; and to improve them as he will, for the good of his Church, and believing Servants, he hath ſuch abſolute power over all our ſickneſſes, <hi>that he ſaith to one goe and it goeth, and to another come, and it cometh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This Text in <hi>Math.</hi> doth hold forth that part of the Humiliation of Jeſus Chriſt in ſubmitting himſelf to bodily infirmityes and diſeaſes, which he took, and bare, he took our griefs and pains for our ſakes, and bare them in our ſtead. It is an eminent part of his ſufferings clearly held forth in the Propheſies; and teſtified in the Goſpel Hiſtory of him. it is a point of great uſe and comfort to the Church, that this ſharp Rod is managed in the hand of a merciful, tender hearted, yea, and experienced Mediator. Jeſus Chriſt his body was mortal, which is evident by this, that he dyed, yea, he came into the world to dye, and therefore took a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal body, capable to perform that great ſervice, which he came to do. The body of Adam in Innocency was capable of Immortality, but by ſin he became mortal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>as by one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin, ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> Though the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt was without ſin, yet he took a mortal body, that it might be a fit ſacrifice for our ſin, which was laid upon him by imputation, being our Mediator, his body was made as Adams
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65391:27"/> body was, out of preexiſting matter, and was therefore mortal. After his Reſurrection, his body is Immortal. <hi>His mortal hath put on Immortality,</hi> his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous immortal body is ſet down at the right hand of God. <hi>And he will change our vile bodyes after the Reſurrection, and make them like to his glorious body,</hi> Phil. 3.21. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reſurrection the bodyes of all mankind ſhall be Immortal both good &amp; bad. The power of mercy will preſerve the bodies of the Elect, to be eternal monuments &amp; objects of mercy, and Subjects wherein mercy ſhall ſhine forth unto all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The bodyes of the wicked ſhall be preſerved in Immortality, to be Veſſels of wrath, in which the juſtice of God will ſhine forth to all Eternity. Thus all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bodyes are capable of Immortality, and ſhall be made ſo to be by the power of mercy and juſtice, which Attributes of God are to be glorified in mankind for ever. This Immortality of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, was a great and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal infirmity of his humane nature, and a fruit of our ſin imputed to him as our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and this made him capable of ſuch other infirmityes as might accompliſh his death; So that it was through the infirmity of a mortal body that he dyed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. for though he was crucified through weakneſs, yet he liveth in the power of God; his humane nature ſubject to our infirmityes, made him mortal, Divine power maketh him Immortal. Though Jeſus Chriſt took many infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, ſickneſſes, weakneſſes incident to a mortal body, yet he dyed not by any ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he dyed a violent death, being in his full ſtrength. Their cruelty and harſh uſage of his mortal body forced (with his voluntary conſent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18.) a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Soul from his body, by much and cruel whippings, they made deep and long Furrows in his back, by piercing his head with Crowns of thorns, knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on with a ſtaff, by abuſing him all night, they gave him no reſt. The Rulers had him to do till after Cocks crowing, then they went to their reſt, if their maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minds would ſuffer them to ſleep; but they committed our bleſſed Lord Jeſus to Souldiers and the rude Rabble, who abuſed him all the night, in the morning they committed him to Pilate, who finally condemned him, and delivered him to be crucified. They oppreſſed his ſpent mortal body by bearing his croſs, they nailed his hands, &amp; ſtretched his body, till all his joints were looſed. At that ſtretch they nailed his feet, they pierced his ſide with a Spear, and let out his life blood All theſe and ſundry more of the laſt ſufferings of our Lord, ſhall hereafter (the Lord aſſiſting) in their place and order be opened; this may ſuffice at preſent to ſhew, that the body of Jeſus Chriſt had the infirmity of mortality, and dyed with grief and pain, a violent death, he dyed not of any ſickneſs. Furthermore in this ſtate of his mortal body when he was in the fleſh, he took many other infirmityes of a mortal body, which are ſinleſs puniſhments of the ſin of man, which may be gathered from <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. where the commination, and infliction of them is expreſſed as the product of our ſin. To eat in ſorrow to labour with diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and to labour with ſweat, until theſe painful labours, ſorrows, ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and diſappointments have brought us to the duſt, out of which we were made.</p>
                  <p>Theſe infirmityes of humane nature may comprehend all thoſe infirmityes uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inſtanced in by Divines, as hunger, thirſt, wearineſs, ſleepyneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The mortal body of Jeſus Chriſt was ſuſteined (as our bodyes be) by eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, motion, labour and reſt, in all which reſpects our fallen eſtate feeleth much puniſhment, and the matter of ſickneſſes is uſually contracted, by eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

When he had been hot and ſpent all day with preaching and travail, and then be all night on a mountain at prayer, what aguiſh or feaveriſh fits it might expoſe his mortal body unto, or what aches and pains in his limbs, head, jaws, ſinews, or the like diſcompoſure of his health it might bring, we do experience in our mortal bodyes often, and ſo might he, yea he did expoſe his body to more labour and hardſhip both by night and by day, then we do. That this Propheſy of the Pſalmiſt is ſpoken of Chriſt is moſt evident; becauſe the ninth verſe which is part of the ſentence addeth another aggravation unto the affliction. <hi>Yea, mine own familiar friend in whom I truſted</hi> (viz. with the bag) <hi>who eat of my bread, hath lift up his heel againſt me,</hi> this part of the ſentence Chriſt himſelf doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to himſelf and Iudas, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.18. <hi>he that eateth bread with me hath lift up his heel againſt me.</hi> So that we cannot doubt that the ninth verſe belongeth to Ieſus Chriſt, then why not the eight verſe? if the latter part of the ſentence be ſpoken of Chriſt, why not the former part? Ieſus Chriſt doth moſt perfectly know the meaning of the Scriptures, therefore by the ſure Teſtimony of Chriſt, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy in the Pſalms belongeth unto him, ſo that ſome ill diſeaſe befel him, ſo as that for the preſent he kept his bed upon it.</p>

He was tempted all theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes and forty nights, while he was in faſting and prayer, for <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.13. he was there in the wilderneſs forty dayes tempted of Satan, and <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.2. being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes tempted of the Devil. What conflicts and Temptations he underwent all that time, is not expreſſed, and therefore not neceſſary for us to know, nor fit to enquire, where God is ſilent; it becometh us to lay our hand upon our mouth, <hi>ſecret things belong unto the Lord, revealed things belong unto us, and to our Children, Deut.</hi> 29.29. So much of this part of the ſufferings of Chriſt as is neceſſary for us to know is revealed in the Harmony of thoſe three Evangeliſts before recited, of which I ſhall now ſay but little. Here be three, yea, four Temptations recorded as an Epitome of all ſorts of Temptations, wherewith Satan doth uſually aſſault the Church of Chriſt Jeſus. Theſe are all fleſhly and worldly Temptations, as for Temptations of envy, malice, revenge, and ſuch like, they are the frequent Temptations of hypocrites, but not ſo frequently can Satan faſten them upon ſound believers, in whom there is a living principle of love. Theſe Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I ſhall touch, as they are recorded by Mathew.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt Temptation is to ſenſual pleaſure, to ſatisfie the natural appetites of the Fleſh, all of them being comprehended under that one, of eating, which is the ſtrongeſt and moſt vehement Appetite in the whole wheel of nature, and moſt difficult to govern: govern that, and ye govern all, Theſe Appetites of the fleſh are the dangerous Temptations of this laſt and beſt Age of the Church in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant world, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34. <hi>take heed to your ſelves leaſt at any time your hearts be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with ſurfeiting &amp; drunkenneſs, &amp; cares of this world, &amp; ſo that they doe come upon you unawares.</hi> The ſatisfying of theſe Appetites were the ruine of the old world <hi>Math.</hi> 24.37, 38, 39. <hi>But as the dayes of</hi> Noah <hi>were, ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of men be, for as in the dayes that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying and giving in marriage until the day that</hi> Noah <hi>entered into the Ark, and knew not until the flood came and took them all away, ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be.</hi> Ieſus Chriſt hath fought this field for us, and conquered Satan in all theſe kinds of Temptations, all Temptations unto any kind of Senſuality are conquered by Ieſus Chriſt, who hath both conquered them in his combate, and ſet us an holy and powerful pattern, how we ſhould do the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort of Temptations which Ieſus Chriſt did conflict with, &amp; conquer is fear, which layeth Faith proſtrate, and raiſeth unbelief to uſe carnal wiſdom and ſhifts to help our ſelves, and ſtirreth up carnal confidence and preſumption in a miſapplyed promiſe, which is a very dangerous Temptation to a believer. This Temptation of fear gave a great foil to the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> both in <hi>Egypt</hi> and in <hi>Gerar,</hi> in ſaying his wife was his ſiſter out of fear, and in like manner was the Faith of <hi>Iſaac</hi> foyled. But <hi>David</hi> was a gallant conquerour in this point, that would not touch <hi>Saul,</hi> when the Providence of God delivered him, or expoſed him into his hand, no not to gain a Kingdome by an indirect means: againſt this Temptation of fear, Ieſus Chriſt hath diligently charged and fenced the Church, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.26, 28, 31, 33. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. and in many other places, and by his Conflict with this ſort of Temptations he hath both conquered Satan for us, and hath ſet us an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly pattern how we ſhould conquer them alſo,</p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:65391:34"/>
                  <p>A third and fourth ſort of Temptations. This Temptation is double, the bait is Worldly riches and glory, to ſatiſfye thoſe ſpiritual ſins of Covetouſneſs, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Pride, which are the filth and off-ſpring of mans loſt Dominion. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan preſented a ſenſe-raviſhing, though but an imaginary glimpſe of all the worlds glory. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.5. it was done in a moment of time: but he endeavoured to ſet on as raviſhing an impreſſion upon his Phancy as he could, to raiſe in him a Luſt and longing after ſuch another ſight, and eſpecially to enjoy that gallant thing which he had ſeen. We are apt to be taken and raviſhed with ſuch glimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that we are ready to run the greateſt hazzards in the world to enjoy that object. Men are ſometimes ſo taken and raviſhed with a glimpſe of an object of Luſt, as David was: but more frequently and violently with objects (eſpecially if attainable) of Riches, Gain, Profit, Honour, to ſatiſfie Covetouſneſs Ambition, Pride, Worldly greatneſs: and upon this account, will be hired and allured from the Worſhip and Service of God, and Communion of Gods people therein: as <hi>Lot</hi> was, who being raviſhed with the riches and fertility of the Plains of <hi>Sodom,</hi> was content, yea choſe to part with Abrahams Family, and communion in the worſhip and ſervice of God there exerciſed, and to goe unto Sodom and to live among them. How often have we ſeen men enamoured with a good Farm (as they eſteemed and fancied it) for the enjoyment of which, they have left the Neighbourhood, and communion of Saints, and of the Church, and gone to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in a wilderneſs, where they are compaſſed about with their own land and Beaſts. Yea ſuch is the power of this Bait, that the hook within will catch and engage them, not only to part from the true worſhip of God, but to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to Devil-worſhip. As <hi>Demas</hi> forſook Paul and the Goſpel, and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the preſent world, to obtain a great Living, to be a Prieſt in an idol Temple, as Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory informeth us.</p>
                  <p>And how many in our dayes, are hired againſt their light, from the Truth, and Proteſtant Religion, unto Popery by a fat Biſhoprick, a Cardinals cap, a tripple crown? And thus the Devil thought to hire Jeſus Chriſt to Devil-worſhip, by a falſe pretence, that he had power to make him poſſeſſor of all that glory, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had given him ſuch a raviſhing glimpſe. But Jeſus Chriſt hath fought this great Battel, and conquered the Devil, and all theſe kinds of Temptations for us, and come off Conquerour, and ſet us a pattern how we may doe ſo alſo.</p>
                  <p>From this admirable Hiſtory of Jeſus Chriſt his ſuffering himſelf to be tempted by the Devill, even to the uttermoſt of his power and skill, we may gather up ſome <hi>General Conſiderations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt.</hi> See the marvellous power of fictitious Imaginations, and figments of the mind. What ſtrong conceptions and mental productions of Sin they fill the Souls of men withall. They prevailed not ſo far with Jeſus Chriſt as to pollute him, but to tempt him to the uttermoſt. Mad men doe many times ſpeak out their mental fictions and conceptions: but ſober men have more command over themſelves, than to vent and ſpeak out what is boyling in their hearts. But the thoughts and figments of the mind are ſeldome quiet, unleſs they be overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſoul-ruling imployment and Spirit. The preſence and Worſhip of God ſhould over-bear them, and often doth: Yet vanity of mind, running after theſe mental figments, is a mournfull complaint of Gods Children, as being a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vexatious ſore, and bitter interruption, even in our beſt Services: and well if this be bitter! they doe the leſs hurt, they are moſt pernicious when they are ſweet, pleaſant, delightfull. Theſe kind of Temptations hath Jeſus Chriſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65391:34"/> and conquered, he was now exerciſed in an extraordinary duty of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and prayer, at his making entrance upon his publick Miniſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ry, and lo, what interruption he met with by theſe fictitious imaginations and figments which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan aſſaulted him withal. But praiſed be his grace, he hath conquered them for our great encouragement and advantage.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee the great power Satan hath over the minds and phanſies of men, by theſe fictitious imaginations, and fgments, he can tranſport us up and down in the world, as he liſteth, to ſuit and to promote his Temptations. Jeſus Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf, at this time of his Temptation, to be tranſported by Satan. One while he was tranſported on to the top of one of the Pinnacles of the Temple, and there was affected and terrified with fear. This was a mental figment, which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſuffered Satan to inject into his holy mind, that he might experience ſuch Temptations, and conquer them for us. So likewiſe when he tranſported him into an exceeding high mountain, and there ſhewed him all the Kingdomes of the World, and the glory thereof; this was but a fiction, a figment and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Satan (having permiſſion) injected into his holy mind, for it is moſt certain, that there is no ſuch mountain in the world, where ſuch an object is to be ſeen, much leſs in a moment of time to be performed, as <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith it was, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.5. therefore theſe Temptations of mental figments, and vanity of mind, which were (doubtleſs) no ſmall interruption to his holy heart, in that holy ſervice and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip he was about. But bleſſed be his Name, as he hath experienced our Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which are ſuch a ſad and doleful annoyance to us, ſo he hath conquered them for us, and ſet us a pattern how we ſhould do ſo alſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 We ſee the great ſubtlety and policy of Satan, to watch for, catch, and lay hold on, and improve the opportunity, when his Temptation may be moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged, to take place and prevail.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He had waited forty dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> till Jeſus was an hungry, before he aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with that Temptation, to ſatisfie his Appetite, though by unlawful means, or not by the ordinary means.</p>
                  <p>The order of the time of theſe Temptations, is not ſtrictly to be inſiſted upon, as appeareth by <hi>Luke,</hi> who placeth that Temptation ſecond, which <hi>Mathew</hi> placeth third. And beſides, this Temptation which they all place firſt, was not acted till the end of the forty dayes faſting: becauſe the Text ſaith, <hi>that he was an hungry,</hi> which gave Satan his opportunity, and it may very well be, that the other Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which are recorded, were acted, before this at the end of the forty dayes, for the Text ſaith, <hi>that he was tempted forty dayes.</hi> Satan plyed him every day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving liberty ſo to do, he would not ſtay till the forty dayes of his liberty were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before he began his Temptations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When he had brought his Phanſy into an apprehenſion of danger then he ſtirs up fear, and this urges to approve (in Phanſy) ſome unlawful ſhift to avoid the danger, as he dealt with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to deviſe a way of eſcape on, or upon an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination that ſuch a danger might befall him. And Satan doth ſedulouſly labour to put us upon falſe confidence in a miſapplyed or miſinterpreted promiſe, as it was Joſiahs caſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.28. he had this promiſe, <hi>I will gather thee to thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and thou ſhalt be gathered to thy grave in peace,</hi> a miſinterpretation of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, made Joſiah over bold to fight againſt <hi>Pharaoh Netho,</hi> 2 Chron. 35.20, <hi>ad</hi> 25. where he was ſlain.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When he had tempted him with the moſt raviſhing ſight of the worlds glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then he tempts him to get it upon any Terms, even to take it at the uſurping
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65391:35"/> hand and gift of the Devil, and to do homage to the Devil for his preferment, as if he ſhould ſay, do but thank me, and acknowledge me ſo far, and I will give thee it all. Men will do any thing for a Kingdome, or a Popedome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Jeſus Chriſt deſpiſed them all, and hath conquered this tickling Temptation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth general conſideration, ſee the conſtant way by which the Lord Jeſus doth anſwer, expel, and conquer every kind of Temptation, <hi>viz.</hi> by reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting it by the Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God. The Scripture is a weapon mighty through God, and if we be diligent it is alwayes ready at hand, for our uſe and defence, when all our actions and conflicts are regulated by a command, the promiſe will ever be ready to aſſiſt, and protect us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. See the powerful Effect of a pertinent application of a Scripture in our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the ſpiritual War, in repelling and reſiſting of Temptations, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. <hi>reſiſt the Devil, and he will fly from you,</hi> The Sword of the Spirit is an holy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, that he dares not conflict with, if Satan aſſault thee, and find thee well armed and furniſhed with the Scripture, he will ſoon depart, and let his Temptation fall, or ly by at preſent, watching for a fitter ſeaſon, for that or any other Temptation whereby he may do thee a miſchief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why did Jeſus Chriſt ſuffer his holy, pure, humane nature to be ſo far under the power of Satan, as to be tranſported in ſuch an hideous manner, from the wilderneſs to the City, to the Temple, to the top of a Pinacle, to the top of an high mountain, and there to be deluded with a vain ſight? Satan hath a great power over the Phantaſies of men, and he can (when leave is given unto him) tranſport their Phantaſies and imaginations unto ſuch ſtrange notions and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and therefore ſtill the queſtion remaineth, why did our Lord Jeſus ſuffer his pure mind to be afflicted with ſuch tranſporting Temptations?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe this is a great part of the puniſhment due unto the ſin of man, to be given up unto, and under the power of Satan, unto his ſeductions and Temptations, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. <hi>in times paſt ye walked according to the courſe of this world, according to the Prince of the power of the Air, the Spirit that now worketh in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>from the power of Satan.</hi> Mankind are lawful Captives to juſtice, and we are delivered up unto Satan to be our jaylor, and one part of the power which the Goaler hath over us, is this, to work in our hearts, minds, Phantaſies and affections, this is a deep and dreadful part of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin, our mental bondage is a ſore bondage; there is abundantly more ſin committed in the minds, thoughts, and imagination, then in outward actions, There be frequent Murthers, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, Blaſphemies, and what not. There be many abominations within, that dare not look out, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.16, 18. there be ſeven abominations, whereof one is; <hi>an heart that deviſeth wicked imaginations,</hi> at the day of Judgement, <hi>when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be opened and judged,</hi> there will be abundance more work in judging the inward ſins of the mind and heart, then of the outward ſins of words and deeds, <hi>it is out of the abundance of the heart that the mouth doth ſpeak,</hi> our ſlavedome to Satan is principally in our minds hearts, and imaginations.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered this puniſhment to the full, ſo far as it could be ſuffered with Innocency, he ſuffered till Juſtice was ſatisfied, he gave Satan leave to do his worſt againſt him in theſe Temptations, as he did at his laſt ſufferings, which are called your <hi>hour and power of darkneſs,</hi> at this time of Temptation Satan did ſaucily domineer over our dear Lord, abuſing his Phantaſie and Imagination to the uttermoſt of his skill, and all this Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered in our ſtead.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:65391:35"/>2. By his ſuffering of Temptations Ieſus Chriſt hath taken away the ſting and curſe, and condemning power out of all our Temptations, ſo that they cannot mortally hurt us; becauſe the Law is ſatisfied by the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, it is the Law that gives ſtrength to ſin, to procure puniſhment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. ſeeing then that the offence of the Law is removed by the ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt, the mortal power of Temptations is taken away, Temptations they may ſorely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, but they cannot kill and damn a Child of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered himſelf to be horribly tempted, that he might be an experienced, able, Faithfull and compaſſionate high Prieſt, to relieve us in our Temptations, and to bear with us in our violent and ſtrange extravagancies, in our vain figments and imaginations. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a mercifull &amp; faithfull high-Prieſt in things pertaining to God, to make Reconciliation for the ſins of the People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our Lord Jeſus gave Satan leave thus to aſſault him, in this part of his inviſible Kingdome, where his power is greateſt, that he might procure for us an abſolute and compleat Victory over Satan, and all his powers and policyes, that no force ſhould be left in his hand againſt Believers in Chriſt. He hath conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his inner Kingdome, the power that he hath over mens minds and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Hereby he hath Satan in ſo ſtreight a chain, that all his Temptations are at the diſpoſe and ordering of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Having ſpoiled Principalityes and powers, he made a ſhew of them openly,</hi> triumphing over them in it <hi>viz.</hi> in his croſs and Sufferings. And this is a chief part of this conqueſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Satans inner Kingdome, in the minds and imaginations of men.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered himſelf to be tempted, and in that caſe to conquer him, that when Satan aſſaults Believers in their thoughts, minds and imaginations theſe may find Satan a conquered and a chained enemy, and that by a man, our Captain, who is God-man: all which he hath done to encourage us to reſiſt &amp; fight and triumph in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered himſelf to be tempted to ſet us a pattern of the way of conquering Temptation. Example and experience doe effectually teach: therefore when at any time we are aſſaulted with Temptations, turn our minds to the pattern of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. and ſee what he did, and doe we the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Jeſus Chriſt hath undergone this field of Temptations, to let us ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the power of the word over Satan and all his Temptations. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual War is a principal part of our Religion; and we ſee that the Word of God is a principal weapon in the management of this War. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.4, <hi>By the words of thy lips, I have kept me from the paths of the deſtroyer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. All this Jeſus Chriſt hath done, to teach us how neceſſary it is, that the word of God ſhould dwell richly in us, <hi>Col.</hi> 3, 16. It is a great Duty, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious mercy to be ready in the Scriptures, like a ready Scribe, that can draw out of his Quiver a fitting arrow for every caſe. Every Scribe which is inſtructed to the Kingdome of Heaven, is like unto a man that is an houſholder, who bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth out of his Treaſury things new and old.</p>
                  <p>By this high and glorious example of Jeſus Chriſt his ſuffering of Temptations the Saints of God ſhould learn much and moſt uſefull inſtruction, touching which I ſhall give ſome ſhort hints.</p>
                  <p>A right walking with God in Temptations, is an eminent practical point of Religion: it renders a man to be a true follower of Jeſus Chriſt, and very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto him. His Diſciples who continued with him in his Temptations, he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65391:36"/> rewards them with a Kingdome; a Kingdome of Grace in this Life, and a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Glory in the life to come. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.18. <hi>Our light and ſhort afflictions,</hi> tryals, temptations, <hi>doe work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> It is unworthy a Believer, a Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt, to ſhrink from, or ſink under Temptations. It is the wiſdome of a Chriſtian to arm and prepare for Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this world, becauſe the appointed way to heaven is <hi>through many tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> Act. 14.23. in this point we muſt be <hi>followers of Chriſt as dear chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

T mptation is Gods School wherein he doth train up his Children to prepare and ſit them for Service on Earth, and for glory in heaven. when Jeſus Chriſt himſelf was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his publick Miniſtry, he began in the School of Temptations, he began alſo with faſting and prayer, he exerciſed theſe preparatories together, and come forth of the School eminently filled with the Spirit, yea, he was fill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Spirit of God doth attend and aſſiſt ſuch as are in Temptations, and doth furniſh them unto ſuch Services and ſufferings as the Lord ſhall pleaſe to call them unto. Temptations are Gods uſual preparatories of his Children for great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, when God was about to call up <hi>Abraham</hi> to be a Father of the faithful, a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone, (in ſubordination to Ieſus Chriſt) of that Church in which Ieſus Chriſt came into the world, and to be a Father in the holy line of the promiſed Seed, we may ſee that God prepared him for theſe great ſervices, by great Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and tryals. When God was about to call up Moſes to deliver Iſrael out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to change the Church polity, to be Gods Inſtrument to create new hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and a new Earth, to erect the Church and common wealth of Iſrael, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervices, we ſee that God prepared him for all this by great Temptations and Tryals. When God was about to call up David to make great Reformation in the Church of Iſrael to gather up and ſettle all the ſcattered parts of Gods inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worſhip, and fix it in a Temple, and to erect a typical Kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt, and to fix the line of the Incarnation of the promiſed ſeed, all of them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and eminent ſervices, with ſundry more that I name not, only include them in theſe generals, I ſay when God was about to call up David to theſe great ſervices, O what a ſtorm of Temptations did he ariſe through!</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Solomon</hi> was called to finiſh what his Father David had begun in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Temple and ſetting in order the fixed national worſhip of God; We read little of his paſſing through Temptatious to humble and prepare him: But we read much of his ſenſuality, whereby he ſo ſtained the glory of his high ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that it ſhould raiſe thankfulneſs to God that pleaſeth to call us up to ſervices of renown, through a field of very great Temptations.</p>
                  <p>We ſee in our preſent ſubject touching the ſufferings of Chriſt, that when the Lord was calling him up to that greateſt and moſt honourable of ſervices, that ever was performed unto the Lord in this world, <hi>viz,</hi> the Redemption of man, and the ſalvation of ſouls. Ieſus Chriſt entered upon the ſervice through many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations and temptations, it is an experimental ſaying of holy men, that prayer, meditation and Temptation make a good Chriſtian, a good Miniſter, a good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, it fitteth a ſoul for any ſervice that the Lord ſhall call him unto.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:65391:36"/>
                  <p>Temptations are humbling providences, they are rods of correction and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that wean us from all kind of ſelf confidence, or ſelf ſeeking; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and purge us in our grounds and ends, in all our motions: and when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is duly ſanctified in his grounds and ends, he is a fitted inſtrument to glorify God in any ſervice whatſoever. The leſs of man, the more of God.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, we ſee that when Chriſt was about to enter into this difficult field of Temptation, he firſt received the Sacrament of Baptiſm, to fulfill all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, no other Goſpel Sacrament being yet inſtituted. Federal Sacram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Communion with God, doth greatly ſtrengthen Faith. We ſee alſo that when Jeſus Chriſt was entering into the field of Death, he firſt exerciſed ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Communion with God, yea double ſacramental communion with God: He firſt eat the Paſſover, and then inſtituted and celebrated the Lords Supper, &amp; then entred upon his garden conflict and Agony, &amp; all the ſuffering that followed even to his Death. By theſe Examples of Jeſus Chriſt, when Gods people are to enter upon any great deſign, eſpecially when they goe upon hazzard of their life, they will, if they can orderly and regularly receive the Sacrament before they enter upon their deſign. Get as near to God as you can. True it is that many doe this ſuperſtitiouſly, &amp; regard not the regular receiving the Sacrament in the Communion of the Church, but miniſter it in private, or in a ſick mans chamber; but conſider, that theſe errors and abuſes cannot fruſtrate the effect of Gods inſtitution regularly attended unto: <hi>Mans lye doth not make Gods Truth of none effect.</hi> Rom. 3.3, 4. Jeſus Chriſt his thus arming and fitting himſelf, when he was entering upon his greateſt Temptation, and upon his laſt conflict with Death it ſelf, is ground ſufficient for our regular attending upon the Lord in our great concernments in like manner as he did. Our co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When Faith is ſtrengthned, all grace is on the thriving hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the work of Faith to goe forth to Jeſus Chriſt, and fetch out of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whatever Grace we want; and to fetch ſupply to enable us unto any Service in doing or ſuffering the good pleaſure of the Lord, whatever it be. Jeſus Chriſt hath ſuffered Temptations deeper then any ever did, and therefore experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally knoweth how to relieve us.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt in the Garden.</head>
               <p>I Contract &amp; paſs over many things in the Sufferings of Chriſt, &amp; come to his laſt Sufferings, in the laſt twenty hours of his life in this world; which laſt Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings were begun in the Garden, and finiſhed at <hi>Golgotha.</hi> In the Garden he ſuffered a Soul Agony, under the ſence of the Curſe, and puniſhment due to the ſin of Man, and under the ſenſe of the bitter cup of death, which he was now going about to drink. And no ſooner was there an Intermiſſion of the rigour of that Agony, but preſently he was betrayed, and fell into the hands of his Enemies that ſought his life. I ſhall briefly touch ſome parts of the Hiſtory, to ſhew how and when he came into this garden, and how he was there betrayed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Covetouſneſs of Judas, and a deſire to pilfer, and rob the bag which Jeſus his Maſter had truſted him with, was the bottome wheel of this Treaſon, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.4, 5, 6. <hi>Then ſaid one of his Diſciples, Judas Iſcariot, Simons ſon, which ſhould betray him, why was not this ointment ſold for three hundred pence and given to the poor?</hi> This he ſaid, not that he cared for the poor, but becauſe he was a thief &amp; had the bag, and bare what was put therein. It is a dangerous temptation to a covetous man, to carry another mans Bag. Mathew ſayes <hi>Math.</hi> 26.8. <hi>the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had indignation,</hi> ſhewing that Judas ſpake from an heart filled with anger and diſdain againſt his Maſter, that had cauſed him to loſe ſuch a fat gob of gain: and the reſt of the Diſciples in their innocency were led to conſent to Judas. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.4. ſaith <hi>ſome of them had indignation:</hi> but John ſheweth, that it was the ſpirit of Judas that ſo vented himſelf, and why he did ſo. The reſt that conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him were only ſuch as were miſled in their ignorance of Judas his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as Judas had thus vented his indignation, the Devil entered into his Soul, and ſuggeſted to him how he might have his gains made up that he had now loſt, he might get a great piece of money, if he would but goe to the chief Prieſts, and offer to betray his Maſter to them. And that it was thus, Luke te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.3, 4. <hi>Then entered Satan into Judas Iſcariot being one of the twelve, and he went his way and communed with the chief Prieſts and Captains, how he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him unto them.</hi> Both Mark and Luke ſay, they promiſed him money: but Mathew tels the Sum they bargained for. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.15. <hi>for thirty pieces of ſilver.</hi> And now his covetous heart was fatted; but he muſt be ſure to perform his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, elſe he ſhould not have his wages: therefore now he ſtudied and watched for an opportunity to doe what he had agreed to doe. The love of money may well be ſaid to be the root of all evill. Satan can bring about a covetous heart to run himſelf into horrid ſins for ſmall gains. Did he eſteem the bloud of a man of his Lord and Maſter, our Saviour, at no greater price? But ſo it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.12, 13. We ſee alſo what a dangerous thing it is, to ſuffer our hearts to be blown up into indignation, for the loſs of an opportunity of getting gain, eſpecially unjuſt gain: for the Devil hath an open door thereby to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul, and to put them upon ſome wicked deſigns.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The execution of this treaſon, this bloudy bargain, was alſo done in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiſh Fury, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe Jeſus Chriſt diſcovered his treaſon, and him to be the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65391:37"/> Traitor before all the Diſciples to his diſgrace. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.25. <hi>Then Judas which betrayed him ſaid Maſter is it I?</hi> Ah bold wretch, whoſe Conſcience is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ared with pieces of ſilver. That which Jeſus anſwered was, <hi>Thou ſayeſt it,</hi> Yet this was not ſo full a diſcovery, he made a ſhift to bear that: but the full diſcovery is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by John, who was a Speaker in the matter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.23 <hi>ad</hi> 28. <hi>Now there was leaning on Jeſus boſome one of his Diſciples whom Jeſus loved: Simon Peter beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him that he ſhould ask who it ſhould be of whom he ſpake, he then lying on Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus breaſt ſaith unto him, Lord who is it? Jeſus anſwered, he it is to whom I ſhall give a Sop when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the Sop he gave it to Judas Iſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, the Son of Simon. And after the Sop, Satan entered into him. Then ſaid Ieſus to him, that thou doeſt, do quickly.</hi> This Sop did ſo plainly diſcover Iudas, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill entered with it, and ſwelled his heart into a reſolution of a preſent execution of his bloudy bargain and treaſon. O what a Soul did this man eat the Paſſover withall!</p>
               <p>Hypocrites though they love their Sins and deſigns, yet they cannot abide to be ſeen and diſcovered. The diſcovery of a bloudy Plot, will make an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite rage, as it did Judas: but it will make a godly heart very thankful to God that hath prevented his ſin: as it was with Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>id, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32, 33. when Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gail did prevent him from murdering Nabal, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, who ſent thee this day to meet me, bleſſed be thy advice, and bleſſed be thou that haſt kept me this day from coming to ſhed bloud.</hi> When the Spirit of God enters with prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Counſel, the effect is gracious. But if Satan enter with the diſcovering Sop, he will blow up Hell fire in that boſome, as it was with J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>das.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When Judas went out in that de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>illiſh Fury, that Satan had blown up his heart into, it was night, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.30. A fit ſeaſon for Traitors and Hypocrites to act their deſigns and works of darkneſs in. It was after day-light was ſhut in, for then it is ſaid to be night: it might be near eight of the Clock; for he tarried untill the Paſſover was celebrated. And when Jeſus Chriſt meaneth to inſtitute the Goſpel Sacrament of his Supper, he firſt huſhed and haſted away Judas: and when he was gone, then he inſtituted the Lords Supper, and finiſhed it with a Pſalm: and after it he had that gracious Conference recorded by John in <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> 13, 14, 15, 16. And after all this, he uttered that gracious mediatorial Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. All theſe were moſt heavenly Preparatoryes for his own Sufferings, and the Sufferings of his Diſciples, which were not ſmall. And although that word be recorded <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.31. <hi>ariſe, let us go hence,</hi> yet they did not goe pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for they went not till that Prayer <hi>Cap.</hi> 17. was uttered, as appears <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.1. when Jeſus had ſpoken theſe words, he went forth, though ſome of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in theſe Chapters might be diſcourſed by the way.</p>
               <p>By this pattern of Chriſt his celebration of the Supper, here is much inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction how we ought to keep our Sacramental Communion as pure as we can, and may be capable to doe in this our ſtate militant, and to be filled with holy, ſpiritual and heavenly conference after it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. While Jeſus and his Diſciples were thus exerciſed in theſe holy ſervices, conferences and Prayers, <hi>Iudas</hi> was among the chief Prieſts and Phariſees, who by that time of night were at home, and ſoon ready to attend the motion of their traiterous Companion. Yet Iudas found difficultyes and delayes in getting all things ready: to get a Company of men, and Officers; their Commiſſion &amp; arms clubs, ſtaves, and other weapons, lanthorns, torches <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Judas found that he had thruſt himſelf into a troubleſome employment. And however he intended
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65391:38"/> to have diſpatched quickly, according to that diſcovering word which Jeſus Chriſt ſpake to him at his going out, <hi>what thou doeſt, doe quickly,</hi> intimating that it was in the plot and purpoſe of his heart to ſurprize him there, in the place where they kept the paſſover. But he found ſo many difficultyes and delayes, that it was near about midnight ere he could get all things ready, as will appear in the Sequel.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After this holy communion, Conference and prayer, Jeſus with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples went forth, and entered into the ſuffering garden, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.1. When Jeſus had ſpoken theſe words, he went forth with his Diſciples over the brook Kedron there was a Garden into which he entered with his Diſciples: where firſt he placed his Diſciples where they might be within ſight and hearing of what ſhould come upon him, but out of the way of Judas and his Company for their ſafety. ſo carefull was our Lord of his poor Lambs, when a company of wolves were to come amongſt them. That which he commanded them was, <hi>Sit here, till I go &amp; pray yonder.</hi> Luk. 22.40. <hi>pray that ye enter not into Temptation. Then he took Peter James and John and went a little further.</hi> And now did he enter into his Soul-agony, with wonderfull horror and diſtreſs, even to death.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His body was not under any immediate ſuffering, as yet, only as it did co-ſuffer, and ſympathiſe with his Soul, in its terrible Agony, ſo deep and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble were the horrors of his Soul, as that his body was ready to faint away and dye.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.43, 44. there appeared an Angel unto him from Heaven ſtrengthening and being in an Agony he prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood, falling down to the ground. The extremity of his Soul ſorrow did wring and torture the whole wheel of nature. And that this Agony was firſtly upon his Soul, is expreſly teſtified by Mathew and Mark, ſuch a load of ſorrow lay upon his Soul, that he could ſcarce live under it. The ſame is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Propheſy, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10. <hi>Thou ſhalt make his Soul an offering for ſin,</hi> which Text ſhews that the cauſe of this ſorrow was the load of our ſin, which lay upon him, being our Surety, Luke calleth it an Agony, <hi>ver.</hi> 44.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Soul Agony is expreſſed by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf who felt it, in ſuch ſignificant words as do make it appear to be a very extream torment that he was in. Sorrowful, or ſo beſet round with ſorrows, and he was ready to faint and dy away, he felt the greateſt terror, conſternation, and diſtreſs of mind, that a mans Soul was capable to be in, yea, his terror was greater, then any one was able to bear except himſelf who is God-man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This diſtreſs of Soul was begun five dayes before the Paſover, as appeareth <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.27. <hi>now is my Soul troubled</hi> &amp; what ſhall I ſay? <hi>Father ſave me from this hour, but for this cauſe came I unto this hour.</hi> That this was ſpoken five dayes before the Paſsover, appears, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.1. <hi>ſix days before the Paſover Ieſus came to Bethany,</hi> &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 12. on the next day much people were come to the Feaſt, and then Jeſus went up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and then was this word ſpoken by him, ſo that he had been long in ſome degrees of this Agony, yea, long before his Soul was diſtreſſed about it, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.50. <hi>but I have a Baptiſme to be baptized with, and how am I ſtreightned, preſſed, pained till it be accompliſhed,</hi> ſo that that Propheſy is herein (in part) accompliſhed, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.3.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65391:38"/> 
                  <hi>a man of ſorrows, acquainted with griefs,</hi> his Soul was in continual ſorrow &amp; diſtreſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Soul Agony was not inflicted upon him by man, nor by Devils, no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was able to put his bleſſed Soul into ſuch a condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Who was it that put his Soul into this diſtreſs? I anſwer, it was his Father that gave him this Cup to drink, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.11. <hi>the Cup which my heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given me ſhall I not drink it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Iſai. 53.6. <hi>the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all,</hi> he ſuffered the wrath and curſe of God, the puniſhment due to the ſin of man, he is our ſurety, he ſtood in our ſtead, and divine juſtice inflicted upon him all the puniſhment due to our ſins. And he ſpared not to lay upon him till he was fully ſatisfied, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He ſpared not his own Son,</hi> here he drank the firſt deep draught of the wrath of God due to our ſin, on the Croſs, he drank the laſt draught, and then he dyed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He turned the Innocent reluctancies of humane nature into prayers unto his Father, who laid this load upon him, and ſubdued, and ſuppreſſed them with humble, holy ſubmiſſion to his will, and then drank, and this he did three times, he made three draughts of this bitter cup which he drank in the garden. And it pleaſed the Father to give him interims of ſome eaſe, ſo that after his firſt ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he went unto his Diſciples, and awaked them, (poor watch men) and then returned to his dreadful work again, and ſubmitted the ſecond time, and drank, then went he again to his Diſciples and did the ſame with a check to <hi>Peter</hi> by Name, and returned again and prayed, and ſubmitted, and drank the third draught, and then he had an interim again. And by that time the Traitor Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das and his Companions were come into the Garden.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In all this bitter conflict he had no humane help, for every time he came to his Diſciples he found them ſleeping, he fulfilled that Propheſy, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 63.3. <hi>I have trodden the wine preſs alone,</hi> and of the people there was none with me. Yet to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and convince us of the greatneſs of this work and bitter ſuffering, it pleaſed God to ſend an Angel to ſtrengthen him, as <hi>Luke</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.43 <hi>and there appeared an Angel unto him from Heaven ſtrengthning him.</hi> The Cup was ſo bitter, that it was as much as life could bear, yet he revived again, and went on in his work, till he drank the laſt draught on the Croſs, &amp; then it killed him, he drank at ſeveral times, that it might not yet kill him; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What is that Soul puniſhment which Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered, which he began in the garden, before they touched his body?</p>
               <p>

And what unconceivable puniſhment divine juſtice hath prepared for ſinners, all that, Jeſus Chriſt hath ſuffered in our ſtead, no man can bear the curſe of the Law but it will ſink him to hell, and there he can bear it but by drops, and therefore his puniſhment is drawn out to Eternity.

Only Jeſus Chriſt can bear it, yea, we may truly ſay, never did any wounded Soul in the work of converſion feel ſuch Soul wounds as Jeſus Chriſt felt, and never did, ſhall, or can any Soul in Hell feel ſuch Torments of ſoul as Jeſus Chriſt felt.</p>
               <p>For 1. In Hell every ſoul feels the puniſhment due to his own ſin only, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth only for his own ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the work of converſion the ſoul feels the ſting of the guilt of his own ſin only. But Ieſus Chriſt ſtood in the room and ſtead of all, he is a ſecond Adam, he ſuffered the puniſhment due unto all, and all at once, and this maketh a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful difference. The ſuffering of any one perſon is but as the drop of a Bucket in compariſon of the ſufferings of Ieſus Chriſt. There be ſundry parts and powers of the ſoul; The underſtanding is the great light, ruler, commander of the whole man, in all its actions. The will is the ſovereign uncompelled chooſer in the ſoul of man, that cloſeth with what it liketh beſt. The Conſcience is the ſovereign judge of all that is done, doing, or to be done. The memory is the depoſitory Treaſury where all our ſtore, good or bad is laid up for after uſe. The imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and affections are under Servants to the Soul. And all theſe powers of the Soul, the perſon being in the ſtate of ſin are capable of high torments; as on the contrary, the perſon being in the ſtate of grace through Faith in Jeſus Chriſt they are capable of glory and high joyes.</p>
               <p>Torments enter into the Soul two wayes, as alſo do joyes.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Sometimes by way of ſenſe and imagination.</item>
                  <item>Sometimes by the underſtanding, by the Word and Spirit.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In all theſe wayes, what ever Torment an Innocent Surety was capable of as the fruit of ſin, all that Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered, part now in the garden, and fully upon the Croſs, Our Surety ſtood guilty in the Eye of Juſtice, of all the ſin of the firſt Adam, and preſents himſelf to ſuffer for the ſame, unto the ſatisfaction of the juſtice of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>all the world is become guilty before God,</hi> and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt taketh upon himſelf all this guilt, all the mountains of guilt of all the elect world are rowled upon Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>he is made ſin for us,</hi> and the fiery ſtreams of the wrath of God that burneth in <hi>Tophet</hi> come running down upon him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.7. <hi>thy wrath lyeth hard upon me, thou haſt afflicted me with all thy waves.</hi> The curſe due unto ſin maketh it <hi>a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> Heb. 10.31. <hi>for our God is a conſuming fire.</hi> In this fearful, terrible condition was the Soul of Ieſus Chriſt, now in his garden agony, which ſuffering of Ieſus Chriſt doth ſave believers from it, to the enlargement of our Eternal Thanksgiving, praiſe and joy.</p>
               <p>But Wo be to thoſe unto whom this grace is freely offered, but they rather chuſe the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, and by their own choice plunge themſelves into theſe flames of wrath, out of which Ieſus Chriſt offereth to deliver them, but they refuſe to accept his o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">8. In this garden Agony Ieſus Chriſt had but three of his Diſciples near him, <hi>viz.</hi> Peter, Iames and Iohn, the reſt of his Diſciples he had appointed where they ſhould
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65391:39"/> tarry, further off, and he went ſo often to theſe three to keep them waking, that <hi>Judas</hi> and his Companions ſhould not find them faſt aſleep, and behold the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs of Ieſus Chriſt to conſider their infirmity, he firſt gently checketh them, and <hi>Peter</hi> by name, <hi>could ye not watch with me one hour?</hi> ſhewing that his firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict had been about an hour, and he knowing that <hi>Iudas</hi> was coming, ſet them a little way off, and bid them watch.</p>
               <p>But alas they were poor Watchmen, he found them aſleep the ſecond time, then he giveth them an holy Item and Admonition, <hi>watch and pray leſt ye fall into Temptation:</hi> there is more danger near you then you are aware of. Yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth make a tender kind-hearted Apology for them, <hi>Firſt</hi> accepting their willingneſs of Spirit; and then bearing with the infirmity of the fleſh: for he conſidered that it was near midnight, high ſleeping time; and their hearts were full of ſorrow, which made their eyes heavy <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.45. Yet notwithſtanding the care the Lord had to keep them awake, <hi>Judas</hi> had taken them aſleep, had not the Lord awaked them the third time, for when he came to them the third time he found them aſleep, and now he gives them a ſharp awakening, they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed the ſecond time, but now they were gaſtered; now ſleep if you can. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the hour is come, <hi>the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of ſinners, ariſe, let us be going,</hi> when the danger is upon us it is time to beſtir our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Now the Hiſtory returneth to <hi>Iudas,</hi> whom we left, preparing his Company to execute his wicked Treaſon in betraying his Lord and Maſter, when he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his Company, a band of men and Officers, furniſhed with Swords, Staves, Clubs, Lanthorns, Torches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no doubt he firſt led them to the houſe where he had left Ieſus and his Diſciples, but he found that they were gone from thence ſome hours ago, which might vex them, but <hi>Iudas</hi> incouraging them, he knew the place whither they were gone, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.2. <hi>Iudas</hi> who betrayed him knew the place, for Ieſus oft times reſorted thither with his Diſciples; unto this place he led them; how they got into the garden, is not ſaid, but <hi>Iudas</hi> their Leader knew how to get in, and did ſo.</p>
               <p>And this is greatly to be obſerved, that by ſuch time as they were come, Ieſus Chriſt was ready for them, he had ordered and placed his Diſciples, he had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Soul Agony, and prayers, and he had no ſooner finiſhed that great work, but the Traitor and his Crew came, he ſteppeth out of one furnace into another, he had finiſhed his Soul conflict under the wrath of God, now falleth into the wrathful hand of man, from one ſuffering into another; the time of his laſt ſufferings was now come. In the management of this matter there be ſundry particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Company that came to apprehend this Lamb of God to make him a Sacrifice was a band of armed men, with Officers and Arms, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.3. and <hi>Iudas</hi> was their Leader, a goodly Crew to follow a Diſciple of Ieſus Chriſt, but they are fit enough for a Traitor; they had objected to <hi>Iudas</hi> that they might miſs the right perſon, being night, how ſhall we know the right party? <hi>Iudas</hi> deviſed this dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he told them that he will kiſs the man, and whom ye ſee me kiſs, that is he, lay hold on him, and lead him away ſafely, ſo Mark expreſſes his direction, Mar. 14.44.</p>
               <p n="2">2. According to this agreement, ſo ſoon as they came up to Ieſus, the firſt act that paſſed was, <hi>Judas</hi> came up to Ieſus with a ſmooth flattering tongue, and ſaid, <hi>hail Maſter! and kiſſed him;</hi> The moſt miſchievous and wicked kiſs that ever was given in this world, a fitting behaviour of a bloody Traitor.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Ieſus Chriſt giveth him in a mild manner a moſt dreadful rebuke. <hi>Iudas
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65391:40"/> betrayeſt thou the Son of man with a kiſs?</hi> a terrible Queſtion to all ſmooth, flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but falſhearted Hypocrites, that mean not as they ſpeak, <hi>whoſe words are ſmooth as butter and oyl, but falſhood and venome is in their hearts,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The next act that paſſed was, <hi>Ieſus asked them, whom ſeek ye? they ſaid, Ieſus of Nazaret: he ſaid, I am he:</hi> and with that word opened a Crevis of the Majeſty of his perſon, which made them all to ſtart back and fall to the ground, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably tumbled over each other. And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.5.6. <hi>Iudas that betrayed him ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them,</hi> and it is like fell alſo among them, unleſs his heart was harder than the reſt, and not ſo ready to be daunted in this wicked work he was about: he was the moſt guilty perſon of them all.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But they recovered themſelves again and ſtood up. Nothing will daunt and divert an hard heart, when the Devill doth animate and inſpire them. And all this Company depended upon Judas their Leader and Captain, all the action muſt be attributed to him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Then Ieſus asked them again, whom ſeek ye?</hi> He was more compoſed in his mind then they were, he was in a good work, they were in a wicked work. And by this ſecond Queſtion, he ſhewed evidently that he would not eſcape from them though he could eaſily have ſo done, for he knew their deſign. Then they ſaid again, <hi>Ieſus of Nazareth? Ieſus anſwered them, I have told you that I am he, if therefore ye ſeek m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. The next act that paſſed, was an act of Peter, who ſeeing Malchus a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bold fellow, a ſervant of the high Prieſt, and ſpirited like his Maſter, begin to lay hold on Jeſus, peter drew his Sword, and firſt asked <hi>Maſter ſhall I ſmite?</hi> but before he could receive an Anſwer, <hi>Malchus</hi> going on, he gave Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus one Slaſh, and cut off his right ear, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.49.50. upon which act of Peter, Jeſus Chriſt did three things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> He rebuked the ſword, and commanded Peter to put it up into its ſheath. He rebuked it by that text of Scripture <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. <hi>he that draweth the ſword ſhall periſh by the ſword.</hi> Again, Jeſus Chriſt declareth, that if he had need or deſire of reſcue, <hi>I could ask my Father, and have more then ten legions of Angels</hi> to reſcue me. All that Jeſus Chriſt did for us was by voluntary diſpenſation. Again Jeſus Chriſt argueth, If I ſhould reſcue my ſelf from them, how ſhould the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be fullfilled, which have foretold, that thus it muſt be? <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.50.53, 54. Again he argueth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.11. <hi>The cup which my heavenly Father hath given me to drink ſhall I not drink it?</hi> He had already thrice in Prayer ſubmitted to drink it, and now ſubmitteth again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt touched <hi>Malchus</hi> his ear, and healed it. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.51. whether it did his ſoul any good or not, is not ſaid, there is no mention made of it; only <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.26. A Kinſman of <hi>Malchus</hi> challenged Peter to be one of Jeſus his company. <hi>Did I not ſee thee in the Garden with him?</hi> and no doubt he could have told him, that it was he that cut off Malchus his ear; but becauſe of the Miracle which Jeſus did, in healing it with a touch, the High Prieſt (it is like) charged and they all agreed to bury it in as much ſilence as they could; for it was a great Conviction of their malice, that could not be mollified by ſuch a miracle. But poor Peter was too bold (not in Courage, but Fear) in denying; which how great a ſtumbling it might be to him that charged him, we cannot ſay. But O what a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65391:40"/> ſad Temptation is fear? that cauſed <hi>Peter</hi> ſo raſhly, and ſo often to deny his Lord But we are yet in the Garden, where <hi>Malchus</hi> Ear was raſhly cut off by <hi>Peter,</hi> and miraculouſly healed by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Jeſus Chriſt rebuked the Officers and band of Souldiers for coming againſt him in hoſtile manner, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.52. and Ieſus ſaid unto the chief Prieſts, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Temple, and the Elders which were come to him (therefore we ſee that there were of ſuch ſorts of men in <hi>Judas</hi> his Crew) <hi>be ye come out as againſt a Thief with Swords and Staves? when I was daily with you in the Temple, ye ſtretched forth no hand againſt me, but this is your hour and power of darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Laſtly, They lay hold on Ieſus, and bind him, dear Lamb of God! <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.12. <hi>then the band of men the Captain and Officers of the Jews took Ieſus and bound him, and led him away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Now all his Diſciples left him, fled, and ſhifted away, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.56.

                  </gap>n, Divines do obſerve how the ſufferings of the ſecond Adam do anſwer to the ſins of the firſt Adam. The firſt Adam beg an ſin in the garden of Paradice, and the ſecond Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am began his laſt ſufferings in a garden where Ieſus was wont to reſort, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.2. a good meditation to ſeaſon our garden del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ghts withal.</p>
               <p>Again, the firſt Adam fell by the ſubtile flattering Serpent, acted by the Devil. And the ſecond Adam entered into the field of his laſt ſufferings, by the ſmooth and fallacious kiſs of his Diſciple <hi>Iudas,</hi> again all the world were corrupted by the ſin &amp; fall of the firſt Adam, &amp; all ſorts of the people of the world conſpired againſt the ſecond Adam, and brought him to his ſuffering.</p>
               <p>Again, the firſt Adam by ſin hath brought ſhame upon all the world, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. And now the world do put upon the ſecond Adam all the ſhame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace that they can. Again, the firſt Adam forſook God and his wayes, and now the ſecond Adam is forſaken of all men, his own Diſciples forſake him. Again, the firſt Adam was made a Captive, and hath captived all his Poſterity, and now the ſecond Adam ſuffering for our ſins is made a Captive unto ſinners. But paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe things I ſhall touch a few other things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. See to what a degree of Impudence the Devil can blow up the heart of an Apoſtate, the rebuking queſtion of Ieſus daunted not <hi>Iudas</hi> nor any thing elſe that was ſaid, or done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All men ſhould beware of raſh drawing out of the Sword, it is a dangerous thing, and not to be done without great counſel and deliberation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When we ask counſel, it is neceſſary to have patience till we receive an anſwer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Ieſus Chriſt healed <hi>Malchus</hi> Ear. It is a Goſpel leſſon to do good againſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65391:41"/> evil, Ieſus on the Croſs ſaid, <hi>Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It was the wiſdome and love of Ieſus Chriſt to draw a ſpeedy cover over <hi>Peters</hi> raſh act, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>

Ieſus anſwered him, I ſpake openly to the world, I ever taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whither the Iews alwayes reſort; and in ſecret have I ſaid nothing. Why askeſt thou me? ask them that heard me, what I have ſaid unto them, behold they know what I ſaid.

               <p>Here <hi>Iohn</hi> maketh mention of the Captain, the Band, and the Officers, now this Captain was conducted by <hi>Iudas, Luk.</hi> 22.47. <hi>he that was called Iudas one of the twelve went before them.</hi> Why <hi>Iudas</hi> led Ieſus firſt unto <hi>Annas,</hi> is not ſaid, but it may be gathered, at leaſt probably, he was the ancienteſt of the great men, for he was Father in law to <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the High Prieſt, <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith of him, <hi>that he was a wiſe man,</hi> and it is moſt probable that <hi>Iudas</hi> had made his bargain with him, and ſold his Maſter to him, and that the Band and Officers that <hi>Iudas</hi> led, were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together at his houſe, and there <hi>Iudas</hi> had his Commiſſion, and from them marched upon his exploit to apprehend Ieſus, and therefore when they had taken him, thither they brought him, and there Iudas was diſcharged, for we hear no more of Judas, in what follows.</p>
               <p>But when they came there, <hi>Annas</hi> conſidered, that though they had ſucceſſively acted thus far, and had got him into his hand and power, yet now their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings muſt be carryed on under a fair colour of legal proceedings, the Council muſt be called together, <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was high Prieſt, at his Palace or Hall the Court muſt be kept, therefore when he had gloryed over his Priſoner, and had the honour to apprehend him, he ſent him away bound unto <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> but we read not that he ſent him by, or under the hand of Iudas, he had acted his part ſufficiently. <hi>Annas</hi> ſent him to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> becauſe he was a vehement proſecutor of this buſineſs of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Jeſus to death.

Then gathered the chief Prieſts and the Phariſees a counſel, and ſaid, What do we? for this man doth many miracles. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him; and the Romans ſhall come, and take away both our place and Nation. And one of them named Caiaphas, being the high Prieſt that ſame year, ſaid, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Then from that day forth they took councel together for to put him to death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which Hiſtory we may firſt ſee the occaſion of this vehement motion and meeting of the Council, and the taking up that fixed reſolution, of putting Jeſus to death, <hi>viz.</hi> it was that famous miracle which he did, in raiſing up <hi>Lazarus,</hi> from the grave, after he had been dead four dayes, which ſhould rather have aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their hearts to believe in him, (as many did) then ſo to provoke them to envy againſt him, upon that groundleſs pretence that it would provoke the Romans to overthrow their Nation, if many ſhould believe in him: The Romans alas, were of <hi>Gallio</hi>'s mind, <hi>they cared for none of theſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may alſo ſee in this ſtory the ſovereign wiſdome of God in over-ruling and ordering the counſels of men to make for his own glory, and for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own holy counſel, unknown and unconſidered by them that act them, that which they act for their own bad ends, God permitteth them, and over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them for his own holy ends. The counſel of Caiaphas was cunning, but bloody, yet he was proud of it, in his own conceipt; <hi>ye are a company (ſaith he) of weak men that know nothing at all</hi> (and yet wiſe Annas his Father in law was one) I can tell you of a project whereby we ſhall gratifie the Romans, and render our ſelves wiſe Patriots, that ſeek the Redemption of our Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ah poor man that is ſo ſinful an under-worker of ſo glorious a part of Gods holy counſel. God meant good to Iſrael his Church, howbeit he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11.7. for ſuch reaſons as theſe, Annas ſent him bound, (an inſulting act over our ſuffering Lord Ieſus) unto Caiaphas, from poſt to Pillar. When Annas was come, and had brought his Priſoner, all the Council were quickly together, though it was about midnight, men cannot ſleep till they have accompliſhed their wicked deſigns. They preſently (for they were in haſte to make quick diſpatch) call a Court, and ſit as a Court of Judgement. But it was a private Court, not publick; a night Court, not open for all that would: they ſet a Porter that kept the dore, that none but friends to their wicked deſign (as much as in them lay) ſhould come in, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.16. <hi>Peter ſtood without, then went forth that other Diſciple which was known to the high Prieſt, and ſpake unto her that kept the dore, and brought in Peter.</hi> Whether he that brought in Peter did not ſtretch the line of Truth too far, it is not ſaid, but ſhe that kept the dore was a notable Virago, and ſoon challenged Peter, and drew forth his firſt denyal of his Lord. Why the Court was ſo private may eaſily be gathered, they had guilty Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and were about a black work of darkneſs, and therefore the dark night was not ſecurity enough to them, but they muſt have a Porter at the dore, and one that had animoſity ſufficient, and that they might confide in: they feared that the people would reſcue him out of their hands. It is an ill ſign, that the ſtate of that people, and the actings of thoſe Rulers, are all ſick, and near to ſome publick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity; when they are in ſuch fears and jealouſies of each other.

                  <head type="sub">Come we now to the firſt act of the Council, which acts laid in order together, appear to be ſix.</head>
                  <p>FIrſt, the high Prieſt did interrogate, Jeſus of his Diſciples, and of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.19. what he asked concerning his Diſciples is not ſaid, nor was it worth the anſwering unto, probably he might enquire what chief men of mark and danger, might be among them? alas, Jeſus Chriſt had only Fiſhermen, and men of inferiour rank, Mathew the Publican was one of the chief, and therefore it is like that the Court inſiſted not upon this point. But that queſtion about his doctrine, Jeſus Chriſt ſaw it wiſdome to anſwer unto. There queſtion was not to know and learn his doctrine, for had it been ſo, Jeſus Chriſt would ſurely have taught them; the willing and obedient Ear ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</p>
                  <p>But their Queſtions were captious, intimating that his doctrine was falſe, and crope in ſecretly, now they are willing to ſearch him out, this is to be gathered out of Jeſus Chriſt his anſwer, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.20, 21. <hi>Ieſus anſwered him, I ſpake openly to the World, I ever taught in the Synagogue and Temple, whether the Iews alwayes reſort, in ſecret have I ſaid nothing, why askeſt thou me, ask them that heard me what I have ſaid unto them, behold they know what I have ſaid.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt here declareth, that his doctrine and manner of publiſhing it, both matter and manner had ſigns of truth, and not of error, which is expreſſed in ſundry particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>I ſpake openly to the World.</hi> I did not pick my Company, I let all that would, hear me, errors uſe to be carried ſecretly, truth is open, ſeeks no corners, and ſo hath my preaching alwayes been.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>I taught,</hi> (viz. when I ſolemnly preached on the Sabbath dayes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.16. <hi>and as his cuſtome was he went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, and ſtood up for to read</hi>) in the Synagogues, allowed places for publick meetings, for any that will come to hear.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>I ever taught</hi> (when opportunity ſerved) <hi>in the Temple, whither all the Jews reſort.</hi> This is not excluſive of ſuch times, as ſometimes he took, to teach in a Mountain, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.1. or on the ſhrouds of a ſhip, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>In ſecret I have ſaid nothing,</hi> that is nothing contrary to, or differing from what I taught in publick. This is not excluſive of his diſcourſes by the way, or in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſes, where he expounded to his Diſciples that which he had publickly taught in parables, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.34. <hi>when they were alone, he expounded all things to his Diſciples.</hi> Hence then Ieſus inferreth, that if they ſuſpected him of falſe doctrine, ask them that heard me, they can tell it, why do you ask me? that is not the right way to find out cunning teachers of error, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The next thing that followed this anſwer of Ieſus Chriſt, not as an effect or juſt conſequence thereof, but an abuſive, ſcornful, unworthy miſinterpretation of the words of Ieſus Chriſt, with a moſt rude and uncivil behaviour added thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.22. <hi>when he had thus ſpoken one of the Officers or Servants which ſtood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:65391:42"/>1. He that ſmote him was an under Officer, or a Servant, as the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies. When the chief Rulers, eſpecially the high Prieſts are ſet againſt Jeſus, to perſecute him, it is no marvell that their under Officers and Servants are as ill minded as their Maſters, &amp; then they will be ſo rude as this act ſhews them to be. It was a great ſuffering of our Lord Jeſus that under Officers and Servants ſhould ſo inſult over him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He ſmote him with the palm of his hand, as our Engliſh Tranſlation ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the word: we call it a Box or Cuff on the ear or cheek. The word alſo ſignifies to ſmite with a rod, reed or walking Staff; either way was impudent, contemptuous and ſcornfull.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He backs his ſmiting him with a Reproach, <hi>Anſwereſt thou the high Prieſt ſo?</hi> As if he had made a faulty Anſwer, diſhonourable to the high Prieſt. But he ſheweth that he put a bad conſtruction on his ſpeech, and imputes it to him as a Reproach.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All this was done in the face of the Court, without any check given him that we hear of; ſhewing that they were all conſpired to abuſe our Lord Jeſus. See a like example of this abuſe done unto our Lord Jeſus. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.24. <hi>And Zedekiah the Son of Chenaanan went neer and ſmote Micaiah on the cheek, and ſaid, Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to ſpeak unto thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this ſaucy fellow Jeſus anſwered with a convincing and reproving <hi>Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> ſo clear, and ſo wiſely placed, that he ſpake above exception. The firſt part or horn of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Out of this ſmall part of the Sufferings of our Lord we may gather up ſome Inſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When Church-men are Perſecutors, the Perſecution will be bitter, as Jeſus found it, ſo did Jeremy: Church-men are uſually more cunning, more bold, more ſeared in conſcience, more cruel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Carnal Profeſſors will inſult and domineer over the Godly when they have power in their hand.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Perſecuting Profeſſors will put the handſomeſt face they can upon the vileſt actions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God can and will over-rule the cunningeſt Counſells and contrivances of Perſecutors, to ſubſerve his Counſel.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Guilty conſciences love Secreſy, and to act behind the curtain.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is dangerous to intrude our ſelves into a place or way of Temptation, as Peter did; it may expoſe us to lye or deny Chriſt, and curſe our ſelves; as all theſe falls and knocks Peter felt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Truth is alwayes ſerene, open, ſeeks no corners to hide it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. When Rulers are wicked, ſuch as are under them will be violent.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. A girt convincing Anſwer, will ſtop the mouth of the worſt of enemies.</p>

                     <hi>At the laſt came two falſe witneſſes and ſaid, This fellow ſaid, I am able to deſtroy the Temple of God, and to build it in three dayes. And the high Prieſt aroſe and ſaid, Anſweredſt thou nothing? What is it which theſe witneſs againſt thee? And Ieſus held his peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mark. 14.55. <hi>ad</hi> 61. <hi>And the chief Prieſts and all the Counſell ſought for witneſs againſt Ieſus, to put him to death, and found none. For many bare falſe Witneſs againſt him; but their witneſs agreed not together. And there aroſe certain, and bare falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt him, ſaying, We heard him ſay, I will deſtroy this Temple made with hands, and within three dayes I will build another made without hands. But neither did their Witneſs agree together. And the high Prieſt ſtood up in the mids, and asked Ieſus ſaying, Anſwereſt thou nothing? What is it which theſe witneſs againſt thee? But he held his peace, and anſwered nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here ſee, 1. That though they ſo abuſed our Lord Ieſus for his Anſwer, and for putting them upon the right way of enquiring, <hi>viz</hi> to ask his hearers, to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. All the Counſel there preſent, were unanimous in what they doe: &amp; what do they? They ſought for falſe Witneſſes, that they might find ſome matter; or at leaſt appearance of ſome matter, for which they might put him to death. They carried themſelves, and managed the matter ſo, that all might eaſily ſee their intent, to find ſome matter whereof to accuſe him. Becauſe they were reſolved to put him to death, they ſought not for what was true, juſt, righteous, but for ſomething to criminate him, by Witneſſes. they cared not though it were falſe Witneſs. They encouraged them to teſtifie any thing. And when they miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented his words and meaning, they took the advantage to wring his words to the worſt ſenſe, as appeareth in that Inſtance, when Chriſt ſaid, They would ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and deſtroy this Temple, his Body, and he would raiſe it up again the third day. So John repreſenteth his words, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.19. he ſpake of the Temple of his Body. Nor was there any capital crime in it as they repreſented his words, yet any thing will, ſerve their turn, to be a ſeeming matter of accuſation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They could find nothing wherein two witneſſes agreed, among all the falſe witneſſes, untill two witneſſes ſpake about deſtroying the Temple &amp; raiſing it again in three dayes. And yet theſe two witneſſes agreed not in all points, as <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.59. te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tifieth. Thus they wearied themſelves in vain, finding nothing againſt him, which left their envy naked, without any pretence of a covering.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then the high Prieſt deviſed another device, <hi>viz.</hi> to draw out Jeſus Chriſt to ſpeak; for he kept ſilence all this while. Could they draw him out to ſpeak, they might entangle him in his words, which artifice they had formerly uſed to catch him by. <hi>Mat,</hi> 22.15. ſo now again they attempt that way. The high Prieſt ſtood up (a good civill deportment in publick affairs) and put him upon anſwering unto what they ſaid; and to ſharpen and quicken the matter, he putteth him on in a rebuking way: <hi>What? Anſwereſt thou nothing? What is this that theſe witneſs againſt thee?</hi> But this Stratagem prevailed not, Jeſus ſtill held his peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why did Jeſus hold his peace and anſwer nothing?</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe there was nothing to anſwer unto: they proved nothing; their witneſſes agreed not, they confuted themſelves, they could fix and faſten nothing: there was no need of an anſwer, and in ſuch caſe it is beſt to keep ſilence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He held his peace to fullfill the Scriptures <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7. <hi>He was oppreſſed and afflicted, yet opened he not his mouth. He is brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before her ſhearers is dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He held his peace, becauſe though he was perfectly innocent himſelf, of all they accuſed him of, yet ſome or other of his Elect might be at ſome time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guilty of ſuch evills as they falſly imputed to him, in whoſe room and ſtead he ſtood and ſuffered.</p>

The high Prieſt and Council finding and perceiving plainly, that they could find no juſt matter againſt him, nor any colour or appearance thereof, they invented another way to pick an appearance of matter againſt him, which might ſeem to be of weight in the eyes of the Jews, though it would be of no conſideration among the Romans: and that was by an open and ſolemn putting Jeſus to anſwer whether he was the Meſſias or no.</p>

                  <p>Mark relateth only the bare queſtion, <hi>art thou the Chriſt, the Son of the bleſſed?</hi> Mathew relates the queſtion more fervent, for if this device had failed, they had no appearance of a cauſe to condemn him.

                  <p>All this was done in the night, the blackeſt work of darkneſs that ever was done in this world.

                  <p>VVHen they had done this wicked deed, in condemning our Lord Jeſus to dye, it being deep in the night, They committed their condemned Priſoner unto a company of men, to keep him faſt and ſafe until the morning, and then adjourned the Court till the morning.

                  <p>It cometh now to be conſidered how they uſed him this latter part of the night until the morning, when the Council met again, if any bowels of mercy had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in them, they ſhould have given him ſome refreſhing, and opportunity to take ſome reſt. but they were mercyleſs unto him, who is the ſpring of all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to us, they uſed him cruelly, which uſage is ſet forth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the actors, a company of men, that were charged with the ſafe keeping of him till the morning, they are called, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.63. a choſen company fitted for the purpoſe, that they could confide in, ſpirited like their Maſters.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The time of their commiſſion to keep him, till morning, which was about the ſpace of three hours.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſeveral acts of horrible abuſe, which they did unto him in time of their charge and commiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They ſpit upon him,</hi> Mark. 14.65. which is an act of the greateſt diſdain in the doer, and of the greateſt diſgrace in the ſufferer, a contempt that few will do to a dog, eſpecially in the Nation of the Jew, it was a very great contempt, which the Lord himſelf foretold and deſcribed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.32. <hi>he ſhall be mocked, ſpitefully intreated, and ſpit upon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>They ſpit in his face,</hi> Math. 26.67. this was the higheſt degree of the reproach of ſpitting. God gave a Law about it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>it is the diſgrace of him that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to his brother,</hi> a moſt improper and unſuitable diſgrace unto Jeſus Chriſt, when he was doing the greateſt act of love and kindneſs not only to his Brother, but to his Enemies.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>They mocked him,</hi> Luk. 22.63. and the next word ſheweth that there were cruel mockings, as it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36. the perſecuted Saints were ſo uſed, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.19. <hi>mine Enemies are many, and hate me with cruel hatred.</hi> for</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>They ſmote him and beat him,</hi> Luk. 22.63. the word which the Holy Ghoſt u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, doth ſignifie ſuch blows as do break the Skin; and flayed off ſome part of the skin, where the blow fell, which was very cruel, according as the Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth ſuch cruelty, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>who pluck off their skin from off them, and their fleſh from off their bones, they flayed the skin from off them,</hi> Iſai. 53.5. <hi>he was bruiſed for our iniquities,</hi> they ſmote him ſo hard that they bruiſed him with their blows.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>They blind-folded him, and then boxed him on the face,</hi> and with blaſphemous mocking and ſcorn, ſaid, <hi>thou Chriſt propheſy who ſmote thee,</hi> Math. 26.68. ſuch blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy would affright a modeſt heart to hear it, but no doubt they made great ſport and laughter at it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It was an aggravation of theſe abuſes, that every baſe fellow and ſerva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="7">7. <hi>They plucked off his hair,</hi> viz. of his face, or head, or both. This abuſe is mentioned in the Prophets, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50.6. <hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheeks to them that pluck off the hair, I bid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. They ſpake many other blaſphemous words againſt him, which the holy Ghoſt abhorreth to mention, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.65. and many other things blaſphemouſly ſpake they againſt him, with which they buſied and ſported themſelves all the night.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. They were charged to watch and keep him, and therefore they might not ſleep, and they kept themſelves thus employed, and thereby did not only hinder Jeſus Chriſt from taking any reſt, but alſo they did grieve, vex, and provoke his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65391:45"/> Spirit moſt bitterly. It was the ſaddeſt night that ever was ſpent. And thus they did till morning light; for then the Council met again, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.66. and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jeſus before them.</p>
                  <p>This is the Lamentation, that theſe that did this vile injury to Jeſus Chriſt, were of his own to whom he was ſent, but they would not own him, but condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to dy, which was the work he came to perform: and when they had nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to the croſs, he pardoned them and prayed for them.</p>
                  <p>When viſible Profeſſors of Jeſus Chriſt are Perſecutors of Chriſt, they will be violent and cruel, as now theſe were againſt Chriſt. And no marvail that the Servants and inferiours were ſo cruel againſt Chriſt, for they knew that they pleaſed their Superiours and Maſters. When Saul perſecuted David, every ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject durſt vent his venome againſt David: and Doeg fears not to be an informer againſt him. When Abſolom roſe up againſt David, is it any wonder that Shimei durſt ſhew himſelf to curſe David? The horrible crueltyes and indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of theſe Jewiſh Watchmen, that had the charge of keeping their condemned Priſoner, will all, in many reſpects ſtand upon the account of the high Prieſts and Rulers. They opened their own envy ſo bare and naked, that every body might ſee it. And therefore their creatures were bold to do any thing againſt the Lord Jeſus.</p>

And they ſaid, what need we any further witneſs? for we our ſelves have heard of his own mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was about Cocks crowing when Jeſus Chriſt was condemned, committed to ſafe cuſtody under a ſtrong guard. The Court adjourned till morning, all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes that theſe carnal keepers inflicted on Jeſus, the remainder of the night, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer unto the fifth act of the Council; which for time extended till morning, and for cruelty it extended to Hell.</p>
                  <p>Now in preparation for their proceeding in the morning, they held a cloſe and private conſultation how to manage this great buſineſs. For ſeeing they now had (according as they long deſired and contrived to doe) apprehended him and condemned him, they were reſolved to put him to death. But they foreſaw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficultyes in effecting it. The points conſidered, plotted and agreed in this private conſultation, were ſundry: and their agreement may be gathered out of the anſwer of Jeſus Chriſt in the morning, who gave them to underſtand that he knew their pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s, to convince their Conſciences that he was Chriſt the Meſſiah, for the aſſerting whereof they had condemned him. The Points conſidered of were ſuch as theſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt be ſpeedy in our motions and progreſs, before the people know that we have apprehended him. For it was about midnight that he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65391:45"/> and brought to <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas.</hi> It was about cocks crowing when he was condemned; he muſt be put to death and buried before the Sabbath; for if we ſlack the time, the people will ſurely reſcue him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They conſidered that we muſt ſpeedily deliver him out of our hand, into the Romane hand and power, and it muſt be done early in the morning before the people gather together and hear of it; for otherwiſe the people will ſurely reſcue him out of our hand; but out of the Romans hand, they cannot, they dare not attempt it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Pilate muſt be carefully prepared for this matter. Some of us that may be moſt acceptable to him and prevailing with him, muſt undertake that matter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though <hi>Pilate</hi> was a <hi>Pagan,</hi> yet they knew him to be wiſe, juſt, and of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Romane ſpirit, he will ſtrictly examine the caſe; and we know that we have no witneſſes unto any thing we accuſe him of, wherein the witneſſes agree, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in that Point of deſtroying the Temple and raiſing it again in three dayes, and in that Point the witneſſes do not punctually agree: nor will Pilate think or judge it a Capital matter if they did agree.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Theſe conſidered that they had but one capital matter againſt him, <hi>viz.</hi> that he confeſſed openly before our Court that he is Chriſt the Son of God, which by our Law is Capital, not by the Romane Law. And this is the only point that we can plead againſt him. And this they did plead, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.7. <hi>We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to dye, becauſe be made himſelf the Son of God.</hi> But of this we muſt ſpeak hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They conſidered that of this point we have no witneſſes, only his own confeſſion, and what if he ſhould deny it, or not confeſs it before Pilate; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt make this point ſure.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Hereupon they agreed early in the morning, before the people be ſtirring, to ſit in Council again, and examine Jeſus about this point onl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, to bring him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it a ſecond time, and to try if he will ſtand to it. And if he ask any queſtion to divert or delay us, anſwer him not a word to any thing, but hold him to this point only, to make the matter of our accuſation ſtrong again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> him, and clear.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Care was taken to adviſe as great a Crew of their own ſide, as they co ld, to ſtand next to the Court, and exclude others as much as handſomely they could, ſo they acted.</p>
                  <p>Very early all the Council (<hi>viz.</hi> all that conſented and conſpired in this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) met, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.66. <hi>as ſoon as it was day the Elders of the people, and the chief Prieſts, and the Scribes came together, and led him into their Council,</hi> ſurely they had taken but little reſt, they verified that ſaying of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 4.16. <hi>they ſleep not except they have done miſchief, and their ſleep is taken away, unleſs they cauſe ſome to fall.</hi> They interrogate him again about the ſame point, for which they had condemned him, not out of remorſe or regret of heart, but of crafty deſigne, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.67. <hi>art thou the Chriſt tell us?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt part of Jeſus his anſwer is, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.67, 68. <hi>if I tell you, you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and if I alſo ask you, you will not anſwer me, nor let me go.</hi> Wherein Jeſus Chriſt doth manifeſt to them, that he knew their agreement in their ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. Whereby he proveth to their Conſciences that he is the Son of God. Again, he declareth to them, that the end and ſcope of their queſtion was not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the point, that they might believe, for they were reſolved not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Again he telleth them, if I ask you any thing, you are agreed that you will not anſwer me again; whatſoever I ſay, you will not let me goe: you are
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65391:46"/> reſolved to kill me. Thus plainly doth he lay open their deſign, and reſolution in their private Councell, and detecteth them in their open Councel, ſo open as it was.</p>
                  <p>The 2d. part of the Anſwer of Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>ver.</hi> 69. <hi>Hereafter ſhall the Son of Man ſit at the right hand of the power of God.</hi> The ſenſe and meaning of which words they underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> that though they now ſee him in this low eſtate of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; yet the next appearance that they ſhall ſee him in, is, at the right hand of the power of God. Then they fully opened their trap, and ſay, <hi>Art thou then the Son of God?</hi> v. 70. And this is to be obſerved, that they were ſo eager upon their deſign that they ſpake all at once, <hi>Then they all ſaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then Jeſus cleerly anſwered, <hi>You ſay that I am,</hi> and I confeſs it is as you ſay, that is the meaning of that form of ſpeech, &amp; they were ready &amp; willing ſo to take it. Now they are ſatisfied, they have gotten that which they fiſhed for, <hi>ver.</hi> 71. <hi>And they ſaid, what need we any further witneſſes, for we our ſelves have heard of his own mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now with all poſſible haſt and ſpeed, they delivered him up to the Romane power, as a condemned priſoner to be put to death by them, after their manner, by crucifying, or hanging on a tree. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.1. <hi>And the whole multitude of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe and led him unto Pilate:</hi> all the Court and all the Creatures about them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined in this matter, to deliver him up to the Gentiles, as Jeſus Chriſt had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that they will <hi>Math.</hi> 20.19. and <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.33.</p>
                  <p>The company that acted theſe things, both Rulers and people, are Apoſtates, whoſe day of Grace was paſt, as appeareth <hi>Math.</hi> 23.37, 38, 39. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.34.35. <hi>O that thou hadſt hearkned, at leaſt in this thy day, but now it is hid from thine eyes.</hi> Such Perſons are the Devills fitteſt inſtruments to perſecute Jeſus Chriſt and his ſaints. Theſe Sufferings of Jeſus Chriſt before the Council of the Jews were aggravated by this, becauſe they were his own people to whom he came and offered them mercy, and life eternal, and called them to Repentance.</p>
                  <p>But behold how wickedly they dealt with him: they condemned him, but could find no other cauſe but his confeſſing that he is the Meſſiah: and not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him, but committed him into the mercileſs hands of their Servants and creatures that did ſo vilely abuſe him all the night, and craſtily dealt with him in the morning, and out of envy delivered him to the Romane power to be put to death. And all this did the holy innocent Son of God ſuffer for the ſake of Gods elect, that they might become veſſels of mercy; &amp; to ſhew us how vile ſin is in Gods ſight, who ſpared not his own Son when he ſtood under a juſt imputation of our ſin unto him. And all theſe ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt we celebrate in that high Soul exerciſe in our Sacramental Commemoration hereof.</p>

                     <head>The Hiſtory of Judas.</head>
                     <p>I ſhall ſhut up this Chapter with a touch upon the Hiſtory of Judas, which in this place and time cometh into conſideration, the hiſtory thereof is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.3, 4, 5, &amp;c. <hi>ad</hi> 11. with <hi>Act.</hi> 1.18, 19, 20. in which Texts (if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pleaſe to read them) we may obſerve two principal points.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A terrible Teſtimony ſharpned againſt the high Prieſts, and the reſt of them in their bloody perſecution of our Lord Jeſus, by Judas his repentance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A ſtrong and clear Teſtimony that Jeſus Chriſt is the Meſſiah, by the Jews fulfilling the Propheſies touching him.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:65391:46"/>1. In the firſt ſee, firſt, the occaſion or cauſe moving Judas to repentance, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>when he ſaw that he was condemned, repented himſelf,</hi> this he ſaw in that night about the Cocks crowing, then began his terror, but did he not know before, that they would ſo do, as ſure if he did not, he might have foreknown it, for Jeſus Chriſt had foretold it, and he knew that the end of their hiring him to betray him, was, that they might have him in their hands, to put him to death, but his eyes were blinded, partly by his envy at the expence of the ſweet oyntment upon the body of Jeſus Chriſt, and partly by covetouſneſs, who miſſed of ſuch a booty to pilfer, and principally by the Devils twice entering into him by advantages.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt time of the Devils entering into his heart, was by his envy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at the expence of that oyntment, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.5, 10. when his heart raged with indignation, Satan put it into his heart to betray his Maſter, ſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.2.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond time the Devil entered into him, was upon the diſcovering ſop that Jeſus Chriſt gave him, Joh. 13.27. now the Devil blinded him, for the Prince of darkneſs hath power to blind mens eyes, 2 Cor. 4.4. Two of the Diſciples did ſcandalouſly fall. <hi>Judas</hi> betrayed Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Peter</hi> denyed him, <hi>Peter</hi> the ſame night repented ſincerely, <hi>Judas</hi> repented, but not ſincerely.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The manner of his repentance, the Spirit of terror entered into him, broke open his blinded eyes of underſtanding and conſcience, to ſee his ſin of blood guiltineſs, Yea innocent blood, yea, the blood of his Lord and Maſter, yea, whom he had for a bribe of money moſt trayterouſly betrayed; this Spirit of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was the Spirit of God, of the Law, that bore down the Spirit of Satan that blinded him: this brought him to horror and diſtreſs. The thirty pieces of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that before had ſeared his conſcience to hardneſs, now torment and burn his conſcience, and in this caſe was his tormented Soul till morning.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The progreſs of his repentance, he knowing the Council had appointed to meet early in the morning, reſolved to go unto them, and reſtore unto them their mony, and confeſs his great ſin in betraying the innocent blood of his Maſter.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly, ſo ſoon as they had confirmed their condemnation of him, and commanded him to be delivered to Pilate, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. Then Judas appears before them in the terror of his Soul, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. he juſtifieth Ieſus Chriſt to be innocent, and himſelf an horrible ſinner in betraying him, which confeſſion of his, accuſed them alſo to be horrible ſinners in condemning him. He offered them the mony with which they had hired him, it ſcalded his Conſcience, he could not keep it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. See their anſwer, the wickedeſt anſwer that ever Miniſters gave to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed ſoul, but befitting the mouths of wolves in the purſuit of innocent blood, and fit enough for ſo vile a Traitor, the worſt that ever was in the world. Their anſwer was ſhort and ſnappiſh. 1. <hi>What is that to us?</hi> ſay you ſo Caiaphas, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas and the reſt? did not you hire him with that mony? 2. They ſay, <hi>look thou to that:</hi> is this your care of a ſoul in diſtreſs? is this your care of your flock? 3. They refuſed to take the money, or meddle with it; nor did they give him one word of comfort or counſel, <hi>the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge,</hi> and is this all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief he had at their mouth?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Now <hi>Judas</hi> is not only diſtreſſed but forſaken, there was but one dore of hope for relief left, and that was to go to the Temple, and to the Prieſts that were there attending the ſervice in the Temple, thither he came with a gaſtly countenance; there alſo he confeſſed his ſin, offered them the Soul tormenting money, but they abhorred to touch ſo execrable a thing, nor had they one word of comfort for him, now he fell into utter deſperation, which had theſe effects.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:65391:47"/>1. He caſt down the mony in the Temple, that bloody, that ſoul-tormenting mony, that execrable thing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He went away to a place fitting, that Satan could eaſily ſuggeſt to him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There he hanged himſelf. But fourthly the rope either broke or ſlipt, and he fell, and the place was ſuch, either by height or by Rocks beneath, that by his fall he burſt aſunder, and his bowels guſhed out. And all this was famouſly known in all Ieruſalem.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why did not <hi>Judas</hi> go to Ieſus Chriſt as the penitent Thief did?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. Becauſe he was the child of perdition, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.12. Again Ieſus Chriſt was now in Pilats Court, <hi>Judas</hi> his Teſtimony was terribly ſharpened againſt the Iewiſh Court, &amp; thither he went, &amp; hath left a dreadful warning what a dangerous thing it is to envy at others charity and bounty, to covet and deſire, to pilfer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans, or a publick bag, and to rob God. <hi>Judas</hi> his confeſſion was not fitting for Pilats Court.</p>
                     <p>Touching the ſecond part of the Hiſtory, it was acted afterwards, after the Feaſt, wherein their own actions do ſtrongly prove that Ieſus Chriſt is the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, by their fulfilling of the Propheſy. Why <hi>Mathew</hi> doth call <hi>Zachariah</hi> by the name of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> is not yet revealed, that I know off. Their actions were 1. they hold a Council to conſider what to do with this execrable mony, they agree that it ought not to be put into the Treaſury of the Temple, becauſe it was the price of blood, they agree to buy the Potters field with it, to be a place to bury ſtrangers Pagans, that cared not for the Iews Religion, though they traffiqued to the City.</p>
                     <p>What this Potters field was, may be gathered from <hi>Act.</hi> 1.20. with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy there cited, <hi>viz.</hi> it was a dearned little bit of ground where the Potters had wrought out all the veins of clay, and left it a deſolate plat, out of the way, unfit for habitation, good for nothing, unleſs it were for ſuch a deſpicable uſe as they now bought it for; and this plot did the execrable wages of <hi>Judas</hi> purchaſe, and for that reaſon was called the field of blood.</p>
                     <p>And this is the monument that Iudas, that Traytor hath left behind him, a fit monument of ſuch a vile Traytor.</p>
                     <p>And this is all the portion that this ſelf murtherer left to his Children, as the Propheſy doth intimate.</p>
                     <p>And by the purchaſe of this field, at that price, the Jews have proved that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is Chriſt, the Son of God, and Saviour of the World.</p>

               <p>MAth. 27.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>And Jeſus ſtood before the Governour, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour asked him ſaying, art thou the King of the Iews? And Ieſus ſaith unto him, thou ſayeſt. And when he was accuſed of the chief Prieſts and Elders, he anſwered nothing. Then ſaid Pilate unto him, Heareſt thou how many things they witneſs againſt thee? And he anſwered him to never a word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mar. 15.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Iews? And he anſwering ſaid unto him, Thou ſayeſt it. And the chief Prieſts accuſed him of many things, but he anſwered nothing. And Pilate asked him again and ſaid, anſwereſt thou nothing? Behold how many things they witneſs againſt thee. But Ieſus yet anſwered nothing, ſo that Pilate marvelled.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:65391:47"/>
               <p>Luk.23.2, 3. <hi>And they began to accuſe him, ſaying, we found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caeſar, ſaying, that he himſelf is Chriſt a King. And Pilate asked him ſaying, Art thou the King of the Iews? And be anſwered him and ſaid, Thou ſayeſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Joh. 18.28, 29, 30. <hi>Then led they Ieſus from Caiphas, unto the Hall of Iudgment: and it was early, and they themſelves went not into the judgment-hall, leſt they ſhould be defiled: but that they might eat the Paſſeover. Pilate then went out unto them and ſaid, What accuſation bring you againſt this man? They anſwered and ſaid unto him, if he were not a Malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From what is recorded in theſe Texts laid together, the following Hiſtory is collected.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The place where Pilate began this Court, was in the <hi>Pretorium,</hi> the Roman judgement Hall, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.2. there Ieſus Chriſt was preſented before Pilate as a condemned perſon in the Court (ſuch as it was) a Council of the Iews, and they deſired Pilate to put him to death after the Roman manner, by crucifying him; and by the Roman power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Pilate told them that he could not juſtly condemn him to dy, until he had heard his accuſers face to face, and his offences lawfully proved againſt him, and thereof he called for his accuſers, and witneſſes of his evil deeds.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Anſwer was made that the Iews might not by their Law, come that day into the <hi>Pretorium,</hi> becauſe it was the Feaſt of the Paſsover, and the morrow was that Sabbath, which fell to be in their Feaſt week, and therefore it was an high day, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.31. The Feaſt was to be celebrated ſeven dayes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12 15, 18. in which week one day muſt of neceſſity be a Sabbath, and to morrow is that Sabbath. And therefore they intreated Pilate to put him to death, as one that they had condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. It ſeems that they thought to catch Pilate by this means, to truſt them, and be their Servant to condemn and execute him, becauſe they had condemned him, without ſeeing and examining the cauſe why they did condemn him.</p>
               <p>But Pilate would not do ſo, a juſt judge muſt ſee the cauſe, before he condemn the perſon to die, a juſt judge will ſtand upon his own legs, &amp; ſee by his own eyes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Pilate though a Pagan, yet in prudence ſo far complyed with reſpect to their Religion, which they propoſed and pretended in this caſe, and condeſcended to go out of the <hi>Pretorium,</hi> into ſome open pbulick place, where the Iews might appear before him, all this ſee <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.28, 29. <hi>They went not into the Iudgement Hall, leaſt they ſhould be defiled, but that they might eat the Paſsover. Pilate then went out unto them, and ſaid, what accuſation bring you againſt this man?</hi> Thus Pilate diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them of that device, whereby they thought to have brought him to have believed and obeyed them. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.30. They ſaid that <hi>if he were not a Malefactor we would not have delivered him to thee.</hi> But Pilate would hear and ſee the cauſe himſelf, before he would condemn him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now the chief Prieſts and Elders, who were his Judges before, and had condemned him in their Council, were his accuſers, and they accuſed him of many things, both to vindicate themſelves, and their own act in condemning him and to vent their envy againſt Jeſus Chriſt. That they did thus accuſe him of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things before Pilate, we have it from Pilates own mouth, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.13. And <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Heareſt thou not how many things they witneſs againſt thee?</hi>

                  </gap>ance in three particular accuſations, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.2. <hi>They began to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him ſaying, We found this man perverting the Nation, and forbidding to give tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to Caeſar, ſaying, that he himſelf is King.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:65391:48"/>
               <p>Touching the firſt of theſe, his <hi>Perverting the Nation,</hi> Pilate did ſtrictly examine it, as appears, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.14. <hi>Pilate ſaith unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people, and behold I have examined him before you, and have found no fault in this man touching thoſe things whereof ye accuſe him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Touching his forbidding to pay tribute to Caeſar, nothing is ſaid of it in his examination. It is not unlike, but that the anſwer of Jeſus to that poynt, heretofore, was ſo famous that Pilate had heard of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that asking for a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute penny, <hi>he asked whoſe Image and ſuperſcription is on it, they ſaid Ceſars, then he ſaid, give unto Ceſar that which belongeth unto Ceſar, and to God that which is Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the third point, his being King of the Jews, Pilate asked him, <hi>art thou the King of the Iews?</hi> to whom Jeſus anſwered, <hi>thou ſayeſt it,</hi> he denyed it not, nor at this time ſo fully aſſerted it, as he did afterwards, as ſhall be ſeen in its time and place.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Pilate having given full ſcope and liberty to his accuſers to produce what they would, or could againſt him, and ſtrictly examined all their allegations; he now called upon the Priſoner to anſwer for himſelf. But Jeſus kept ſilence, and anſwered not a word, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.12. then Pilate urged him to anſwer, ſaying, <hi>heareſt thou not how many things they accuſe thee off?</hi> ver. 13. but ſtill Ieſus kept ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and anſwered not a word.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now Pilate falls to admiring, and that exceedingly, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.14. for Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſaw plainly, firſt that they had no proof of what they ſaid againſt him, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that many things they ſaid were frivolous, and far from being capital offences, if they had been proved. Thirdly, that they perſecuted him out of envy, <hi>Mark.</hi> 15.10. he knew that the chief Prieſts had delivered him for envy, and all this increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his admiration at his ſilence. <hi>What are you willing to dye?</hi> But alas, neither his Pagan judge, nor envious accuſers, were aware of what God the Father, and the Son Ieſus Chriſt were now tranſacting touching the great counſel of God, for the Salvation of ſinners.</p>
               <p>For 1. Now Ieſus Chriſt ſtood as our ſponſor and ſurety, to bear the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſins. Ieſus Chriſt now taught and confirmed the great point of the imputation of our ſins unto him, who was perſonally innocent as a Lamb, but as our ſurety he is guilty of all; ſome, or other of his Elect were guilty of whatſoever they laid to his charge, and God laid upon him the guilt of all our ſins, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5 3, 4, 5, 6. he was in this reſpect as being our Surety, the guiltyeſt perſon in the world, the guilt of all ſin lay upon him, and therefore he ſilently bore it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ieſus Chriſt was willing to bear all this imputation of ſin, and to dy for it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.17. <hi>I lay down my life, that I may take it again, no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pilate ſaw plainly how eaſily he might have anſwered and avoided all their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations and accuſations brought againſt him, and that put him into ſuch admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at his ſilence; his Innocency appeared to his Roman Judge, without any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of his, though they had condemned him, Pilate ſaw no cauſe for it, but envy.</p>
               <div n="2" type="act">
                  <head>So much for the firſt act of Pilate, the ſecond act followeth.</head>
                  <p>There is ſome difficulty in laying together the harmony of the Evangeliſts in this point, touching the order of the acts that paſſed in Pilates Court. This ſecond act of Pilate that I am entering upon, is again acted by Pilate afterward, as we ſhall ſee in its time and place, Luk. 23.4. <hi>then ſaid Pilate to the chief Prieſts and to the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65391:48"/> people, I find no fault in this man,</hi> theſe words of Pilate are clearly annexed to the firſt examination, as appeareth, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. when Pilates queſtion, and Jeſus his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer were tranſacted, it was in the firſt examination as we ſaw in its place, and that which Pilate addeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. doth preſently after follow; and therefore I place them next: And render them a part of the ſecond act of Pilate; which I am now about to ſet down in the order of the Hiſtory of actions, as they paſſed in Court, again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.30.31, 32. they anſwered and ſaid unto him, <hi>if he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him up unto thee; then ſaid Pilate take ye him and judge him according to your Law. The Iews therefore ſaid unto him, it is not lawful for us to put any man to death, that the ſaying of Ieſus might be fulfilled which he ſpake, ſignifying what death he ſhould dye.</hi> Which ſaying of Jeſus Chriſt is recorded <hi>Math.</hi> 20.18, 19. <hi>behold we go up to Ieruſalem, and the Son of man ſhall be betrayed unto the chief Prieſts, and unto the Scribes, and they ſhall condemn him to death, and ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to ſcourge, and to crucifie him, and the third day he ſhall riſe again.</hi> This part of the Hiſtory which John relateth, was at, or about the time of the beginning of Pilates Court, as appeareth by the immediate fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going words, <hi>ver.</hi> 28, 29. Therefore laying Lukes record and Johns record toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Hiſtory proceedeth thus. When Pilate had given the accuſers leave to produce what they would againſt him, and had diligently examined all that they had ſaid, and called Ieſus to anſwer for himſelf, though he was ſilent and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing, to Pilates admiration, ſeeing he might ſo eaſily have made void all that they had ſaid againſt him. Now Pilate turneth his ſpeech to the Prieſts and Elders his accuſers, and argueth with them, <hi>you have delivered up this man to be put to death, but I find no fault in him, for which I ſhould judge him to dye, many things you ſay but prove nothing. You produce no Roman capital Law that he hath broken, how then ſhould I iudge him to death?</hi> To this they anſwered, <hi>we have a Law (viz. againſt Blaſphemy) and by that Law we have condemned him, and were he not a malefactor we would not have ſo done, nor have delivered him to you to put him to death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Pilate maketh them a noble offer, it is a point of eminent conſideration, Pilate ſaith, <hi>take ye him, and judge him according to your Law,</hi> exerciſe your own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Juriſdiction, according to your own Laws.</p>
                  <p>The Jews expreſly refuſe to accept this offer, and ſay, <hi>it is not lawful for us to put any man to death. Say you ſo Caiaphas? by whoſe Law is it not lawful for you to put any man to death? Surely not by Gods Law, it is only by the Roman Law that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for you.</hi> So that by this ſaying of the Jewiſh Council they do teſtifie in open Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Pilate offered them the exerciſe of their own Scepter in a particular caſe, they expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed to accept it, for that very reaſon, becauſe the Scepter was departed from them.</p>
                  <p>And though they thus acted out of envy againſt Ieſus Chriſt, yet it is a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable hand of God, that they themſelves ſhould ſo eminently acknowledge, that the Scepter was departed from them. Iohn taketh notice of the prediction that Ieſus Chriſt had given to his Diſciples, foretelling how the Iews would condemn him, and deliver him to the Gentiles, to be put to death after the manner of the Gentiles, all which things were accompliſhed, juſt as he had foretold, which is a great proof of his Divinity. The reaſon of the Iews thus acting was becauſe they durſt not offer violence againſt Ieſus Chriſt by their own power and Laws: for
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65391:49"/> they know that their proceedings were unjuſt, and that the people would not have ſuffered them to do violence againſt Ieſus Chriſt, and yet they were ſo mad to execute their envious reſolution to put him to death, that they rather choſe to put away the Scepter from Iudah, then not to execute their wrath againſt Ieſus Chriſt, they willingly put away the Scepter from themſelves, the Scepter was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Iudah when Ieſus Chriſt was put to death. <hi>O the depths of divine Wiſdome!</hi>

                     <hi>Then Pilate entered into the Judgement hall again, and called Jeſus, and ſaid unto him, Art thou the King of the Iews? Ieſus anſwered him, Sayeſt thou this thing of thy ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lf, or did others tell it thee of me? Pilate anſwered, Am I a Jew? thine own nation, and the chief Prieſts have delivered thee unto me: What haſt thou done? Ieſus anſwered, My Kingdome is not of this world: if my Kingdome were of this world, then would my Servants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Iews: but now is my Kingdome not from hence. Pilate therefore ſaid unto him, Art thou a King then? Ieſus anſwered, Thou ſayeſt that I am a King. To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſs unto the Truth: every one that is of the Truth heareth my voyce, Pilate ſaith unto him, What is Truth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pilate went again into the <hi>pretorium</hi> or Romane judgement hall, out of which he had come to comply with the Jews who would not enter into it that day. Now he goeth thither again, and calleth Jeſus Chriſt before him there, apart from the Jews his accuſers, who would not come thither, and there are ſundry particulars of great moment.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Pilate asked Jeſus this queſtion, <hi>art thou the King of the Iews?</hi> he had asked him the ſame queſtion in his firſt examination, and Jeſus made him that anſwer, <hi>thou ſayeſt it,</hi> it is like that Pilate thought he would be more free to anſwer him, apart from his accuſers, and Pilate was diligently inquiſitive into this point. The Romans had a great reſpect unto royal blood, and all men knew that the Jews were in great expectation of a great King. He therefore examineth him the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time about this point.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Ieſus Chriſt anſwered him by propoſing a queſtion to Pilates heart, which none but himſelf could anſwer unto, and his anſwer to it would diſcover the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the man. The queſtion was this, <hi>ſayeſt thou this thing of thy ſelf, or did others tell it thee of me?</hi> the divine depth and wiſdome of this queſtion, is too deep for me to dive into. But it ſeemeth to be propoſed to inſtruct Pilate, that if he cordially deſired to know that great Truth, it would be for his eternal good and benefit. but if it were only out of curioſity, and for humane diſcourſe, and civil ends only, then it would profit him but little.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Pilates heart felt him, and ſeemeth to be a little ſhort and ſnufty at it, and maketh two replyes, by retorting two queſtions.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. He returns a quick and ſharp queſtion, with the reaſon of his queſtion, yet with ſo much compoſure of mind and judgement, that he firſt expreſſeth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and then his quick queſtion, <hi>thy own Nation, and the chief Prieſts have delivered thee to me as a condemned Malefactor, What haſt thou done?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Ieſus Chriſt knowing that Pilate already knew the worſt they could ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65391:49"/> him, and that there was no weight in their allegations, only they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed with envy and wrath, therefore he declineth to make any anſwer to his quick queſtion, and proceeds to anſwer to his firſt ſober queſtion touching the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Jeſus Chriſt, wherein ſee theſe three particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Ieſus Chriſt delivereth a doctrine, <hi>my Kingdome is not of, (or from) this world,</hi> as authors or conſtitutors thereof, (of) ſignifyeth from in this place, it doth not ſignifie concerning, for the Kingdome of Chriſt is (of or) concerning all the world, and affairs thereof, as the object, or ſubject about which it is exerciſed, but the world doth not make or conſtitute it, it is not the efficient of the Kingdome of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here is a reaſon of this aſſertion, <hi>becauſe if his Kingdome were of, or from this world, then the world would fight for their King,</hi> to keep him out of the hands of his Enemies the Iews, and by world here he may particularly mean the Romans, who have no hand in conſtituting his Kingdome.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here is an exegeſis or explication of this doctrine in theſe words, <hi>my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not from hence,</hi> viz. not from the world, not from the Romans.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Pilate is ſoon calm, and though Ieſus anſwered not to his laſt quick queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (whereof there was no need) yet ſeeing he anſwered to his firſt queſtion, which was the point which Pilate deſired to enquire into, he accepteth him, and replyeth upon him, and asketh, <hi>art thou a King then?</hi> which the words of Ieſus did imply. And gave Pilate a juſt occaſion to propoſe that queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Ieſus Chriſt replyeth to Pilate, and maketh a clear confeſſion of, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a full Teſtimony unto his Kingly Office, and of his Prophetical Office alſo, which is that confeſſion which the Apoſtle maketh mention of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Ieſus, who before Pontius Pilate witneſſed a good confeſſion,</hi> wherein are theſe particulars.</p>

                     <item>1. I will not in modeſty expreſs that word concerning my ſelf, but reſt in that which you have expreſſed, you have implicitely ſaid that I am a King.</item>
                     <item>2. I add unto this Truth my Teſtimony in three things. 1. <hi>To this end I was born,</hi> that I might execute my Kingly Office in my Kingdome. 2. that I came into the world <hi>to bear witneſs unto the Truth,</hi> which is my Prophetical Office, and by my Prophetical Office I bear witneſs to my Kingly Office. 3.

                  <p n="7">7.

                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.38. <hi>Pilate ſaith, What is Truth? And when he had ſaid that he went out again unto the Iews, and ſaith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is manifeſtly a ſecond time of Pilates open teſtifying the Innocency of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as the circumſtances do make it appear. For his firſt Teſtimony was the product of his firſt examination, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.3, 4. This Teſtimony is the product of that private diſcourſe, that Pilate had with Ieſus in the <hi>pretorium,</hi> apart from the Iews his accuſers.</p>
                  <p>When Pilate came forth of the <hi>pretorium,</hi> from his more private diſcourſe with
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65391:50"/> Ieſus, and bore witneſs to his innocency ſo fully, the immediate effect of that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, upon the Iews is related only by Luke, therefore in laying together the harmony of the Evangeliſts. I turn to that <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, <hi>And they were the more fierce, ſaying, He ſtirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Iury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from Galilee to this place. When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean. And aſſoon as he knew that he belonged unto Herods Iurisdiction, he ſent him to Herod, who himſelf was alſo at Ieruſalem at that time. And when Herod ſaw Ieſus, he was exceeding glad, for he was deſirous to ſee him of a long ſeaſon, becauſe he had heard many things of him, and he hoped to have ſeen ſome miracle done by him. Then he queſtioned with him in many words, but he anſwered him nothing. And the chief Prieſts and Scribes ſtood and vehemently accuſed him. And Herod with his men of war ſet him at nought, and mocked him, and arayed him in a gorgeous robe, and ſent him again to Pilate. And the ſame day Pilate and Herod were made friends together; for before they were at enmity between themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this part of the Hiſtory ſee, 1. When the chief prieſts and Jews heard Pilate teſtifie to the innocency of Jeſus a ſecond time, and that ſo plump &amp; fully, they were greatly enraged. Our Engliſh Tranſlation renders the word very well, <hi>They were the more fierce.</hi> The ſhining innocency of any, ſhould the more qualifie and pacifie our minds, and moderate our ſpirits. This is the frame of a good Spirit, that is acted by Gods Spirit. But we ſee that the notifying of the innocency of Jeſus Chriſt, did inrage them. Therefore we may ſee that they we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e acted by a Devilliſh ſpirit. They were reſolved to execute their envy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeſus Chriſt by putting him to death; and therefore they were vexed that the Judge found him innocent, and it made them the more violent in aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng his offences, which they imputed to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They inflame the matter which they accuſe him of, by putting a bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon his good actions, they ſay, he ſtirreth up the people by his teaching; he ſhaketh their hearts like as an Earthquake ſhaketh the Earth, ſo the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth. The word of the Goſpel doth indeed ſhake the hearts of men, but it is to repentance, and to embrace the offer of grace and mercy in Ieſus Chriſt, and this is the real and true ſhaking, and heart ſtirring, that the Miniſtry of Ieſus had raiſed, but they put a bad and falſe conſtruction upon it, and ſay, or intimate at leaſt, <hi>that Ieſus and his followers did ſtir up the people to Sedition,</hi> &amp;c. they pervert the powerful effects of the word that move men to repentance, and ſay, it moveth them to Faction and Rebellion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They aggravate and urge their accuſation, from the extent of the effect of his Miniſtry, and preaching ſaying, <hi>that it moveth and worketh through all Iury beginning at Galilee, unto this place, even to Ieruſalem,</hi> that which is a real glory and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, they turn into an angry and envyous accuſation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Their inſtructing in the extent of the effect of his preaching from <hi>Galile</hi> to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> gave occaſion to Pilate to ask if he were a Galilean. And it is like that word of theirs, put the notion into <hi>Pilates</hi> mind, that he now acteth. When he underſtood that he was a Galilean, he knew that he belonged to Herods Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who was Tetrarch of Galile, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.1. and being willing to ſhut his hands of ſuch an ill cauſe, wherein he ſaw no juſtice, but wrath and envy. The Roman was noble and juſt, he abhorred injuſtice, and therefore he was glad he had found a way to ſhift off this loathſome matter from himſelf, knowing that he ſhould gratifie Herod very much, who had a long time a deſire to ſee Jeſus, which it is like that Pilate knew, or had ſome ſentiment of it, that it would much gratifie
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65391:50"/> Herod. The opportunity alſo was very fit becauſe it ſo fell out that Herod was at that time in town. <hi>v.</hi> 7. an happy juncture for <hi>Pilate</hi> to attain his ends: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Pilate reſolved to ſend the priſoner to <hi>Herod.</hi> This innocent, falſly accuſed Lamb is ſent unto Herod. Pilates reaſon for this act may be gathered out of the conſequent Hiſtory. Firſt he ſhould gratifie Herod. Secondly, he hoped to quit his hands of the caſe. Thirdly, if not, yet he ſhould gain light and aime to himſelf, being a Gentile by ſeeing what Herod a Jew would doe in this caſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Jews paſſionate aggravation of the extent of the effects of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt, from Galilee even to Jeruſalem, gave the occaſion of this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it was very croſs unto them and to their deſign, for they were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to put him to death; yea and it muſt be done that very day; yea and by the Romane power, and after the Romane manner. But if Herod ſhould accept to judge him, that would quite alter the matter: or if he doe not, but remit him to Pilate, it will occaſion much loſs of time: it was therefore a very vexatious matter to them, but thank their own paſſion that gave Pilate the occaſion. But being ſo, they muſt beſtir themſelves, The chief Prieſts and Elders muſt goe and appear before Herod, to repreſent the matter as foul as they can.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When Jeſus came before Herod, then the Hiſtory thus proceedeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. See Herods carnal joy at his coming, and at the ſight of him. We muſt conſider Herod to be a viſible Profeſſor of Religion, though a carnall hypocrite: Pilate was a Pagan, Herod was a Jew; therefore he acts the part of one that hath Religion: therefore he had exceeding great joy to ſee Jeſus: this his joy is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by two reaſon, 1. Becauſe he had of a long time a deſire to ſee Jeſus, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard ſuch famous things of him. 2. Becauſe he hoped he would have been ſo officious to him, being a King, as to gratifie him by doing ſome Miracle before him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Herod queſtioned him in many things, though they were not of ſuch weight, as to be mentioned by the Holy Ghoſt, not any one of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His queſtions would be promoted and inlarged by the high Prieſts and Scribes, who proſecuted him before Herod. 1. They ſtood up againſt him. 2. They vehemently accuſed him: and this would occaſion Herod to ask him many Queſtions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. See the holy wiſe Lamb-like behaviour of Jeſus Chriſt among theſe adverſaries of whom in the propheſy he complaineth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.12, 13, 16. <hi>Many Bulls have compaſſed me, ſtrong Bulls of Baſhan have beſet me round. they gaped upon me with their mouthes, like a ravening, and roaring Lion. For dogs have compaſſed me, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the wicked have encloſed me.</hi> But in all theſe doings, Jeſus held his peace he ſpake not one word: and ſome Reaſons of his ſilence before Herod may be given.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. See a notable effect of this act of Pilate in gratifying Herod by ſending Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus unto him, it removed the enmity that was betwixt them, ſo that they became friends afterwards. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.12. <hi>And the ſame day Pilate and Herod were made friends; together for before they were at enmity between themſelves.</hi> The world can agree to perſecute Jeſus Chriſt and his Servants.</p>

                  <p>Luk. 23.13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>And Pilate when he had called together the chief Prieſts, &amp; the Rulers, and the people, ſaid unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the people, and behold I having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching thoſe things whereof ye accuſe him. No, nor yet Herod: for I ſent you to him, and lo nothing worthy of death is done unto him. I will therefore chaſtiſe him and releaſe him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Herod ſent Jeſus back unto Pilate, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. ſo mocked, derided, abuſed as as above-ſaid, but withall intimated that he found nothing proved againſt him, as Pilate himſelf anon declareth. Therefore Pilate calleth his Court again, and calleth the chief Prieſts and Rulers, his accuſers, who were ready enough; and the people; an open Court, becauſe juſtice muſt proceed openly, not clandeſtinely, as the chief Prieſts, Scribes and Phariſees did in their Court when they condemned Jeſus. The Romane proceeded openly and honourably in his Court, and in the management of this matter thus far.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Pilate maketh recital of what had paſſed. <hi>Ye have brought this man as one that perverteth the people:</hi> You ſee that I have throughly ſifted and examined all that you have accuſed him of, and all this have I done in your preſence. Now I doe ſolemnly declare unto you, that I find no fault in him, in any matter which you have accuſed him of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3, I am now confirmed in my judgment of the caſe, becauſe I ſent you to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod to accuſe him before Herod, and he hath found no fault in him, but hath ſent him back to me, finding nothing in him worthy of death. Luk. 23.15. <hi>No nor yet Herod, for I ſent you to him, and lo nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Therefore I doe now declare unto you that I will chaſtiſe him and releaſe him. But <hi>Pilate,</hi> with your favour, why will you chaſtiſe an innocent perſon? is this Juſtice? If Pilate ſay, I doe it to pleaſe and pacifie the rage of the Jews againſt him: But is this a noble Romane ſpirit to pervert juſtice to pleaſe the people? <hi>Fiat Juſtitia, ruat Coelum,</hi> is a Latine Proverb. And further, when
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65391:51"/> you had performed your firſt word in chaſtiſing him, why did you not perform your ſecond word to releaſe him? But Jeſus Chriſt and his poor Servants may ſee what we are to expect from the hands of Man.</p>
                  <p>Thus far Luke carrieth on the Hiſtory of this Act which Pilate is now about to doe. John carrieth the hiſtory of this act of Pilate further.</p>
                  <p>Joh. 19.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Then Pilate therefore took Jeſus and ſcourged him. And the Souldiers platted a Crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put on him a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple robe, and ſaid, Hail King of the Iews: and they ſmote him with their hands. Pilate therefore went forth again, and ſaith unto them, Behold I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. Then came Ieſus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe: and Pilate ſaith unto them, Behold the man. When the chief Prieſts therefore and the Officers ſaw him, they cried ſaying, crucifie him, crucifie him. Pilate ſaith unto them, take ye him and crucifie him: for I find no fault in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Pilate took Ieſus, namely into the <hi>Pretorium,</hi> a Romane judgement Hall whither the Iews would not goe, therefore now the Lamb is among the wolves, the pagan Judge and Pagan Souldiers have him in their cruel hands, and they did grievouſly abuſe him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They ſcourged him,</hi> and that (as they did all things elſe againſt him) without mercy, with much cruelty, Chriſt complaineth of them in the Propheſy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129.3. <hi>the ploughers ploughed upon my back, they made their furrows long.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>They put on him a purple Robe,</hi> to make him a mock-King.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They ſaid <hi>Hail King of the Iews,</hi> deriding hereby both his perſon and his people.</p>

Pilate commanded only his ſcourging, (ſo far as appeareth in the Hiſtory) but he permitted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved all the reſt, even all that unjuſt and cruel uſage of an innocent perſon. Thus Pilate and his men acted in the <hi>pretorium.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Firſt, Behold I bring him forth to you,</hi> viz. uncondemned, that ye might know that <hi>I find no fault in him;</hi> but with your favour Pilate, is this a ſign that he is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, when you have thus abuſed him? what meaneth that blood about his ears and face, on his back and ſides, are theſe marks of an Innocent man? or if he be Innocent, as you affirm, and that moſt truly, that he is, are not theſe marks of an unjuſt Judge?</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Then Jeſus came forth, wearing the Crown of thorns, and the purple Robe</hi> all bloody, battered and abuſed, baptized with his own blood.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dl. Pilate ſaith, <hi>behold the man.</hi> that is, you ſee I have puniſhed him, to pacifie you, let that ſuffice, and ſo I will releaſe him, though thus much of the ſenſe of the words is not expreſſed, yet tis probable, he laboured to work upon their compaſſion and pitty: but we ſee that no humane policy can quench the rage of the wicked

                  <p n="3">3. When the chief Prieſts and Officers ſaw him, they cried out, <hi>crucifie him, crucifie him,</hi> they made a general out-cry, that little quantity of his blood which Pilate had ſhed, could not ſatisfie them, nothing but his heart and life blood will content them.</p>

Then Pilate ſaith again, <hi>take ye him, and crucifie him, for I find no fault in him.</hi> This is the third time in this 5. act that Pilate hath teſtified to the innocency of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and his urging, <hi>that Herod found no fault in him;</hi> theſe three times ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the former two times, do make it evident that Pilate did make the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of Jeſus Chriſt to ſhine illuſtriouſly, but nothing can make pale blew envy to bluſh.</p>
                  <p>Again, this is a ſecond time that Pilate offered to the Jews the exerciſe of their own Scepter, as he had formerly, in his ſecond act done; but ſtill they put it from them, and refuſe to accept it. For if the Romane power refuſe to put Jeſus Chriſt to death, the Jews ſhall not be able to do it, and yet they were violently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to have it done, it was a wicked Temptation they were by Satan engaged in, ſo publickly, abſolutely, and effectually, to put away the Scepter from Judah, which was ſo great an offence to God, that they never had a Scepter ſince unto this day; but there is a day of grace coming, when the Scepter ſhall be reſtored, and David (whom now they renounced) ſhall be their King. I paſs by all inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

               <div n="6" type="act">
                  <head>So much for the fifth act of Pilate, the ſixth followeth.</head>
                  <p>Joh. 19.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. pt. <hi>The Jews anſwered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to dye, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God. When Pilate therefore heard that ſaying, he was the more afraid. And went again into the judgement-Hall, and ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus, Whence art thou? but Jeſus gave him no anſwer. Then ſaith Pilate unto him. Speakeſt thou not unto me? knoweſt thou not, that I have power to crucifie thee, and have power to releaſe thee? Ieſus anſwered, Thou couldeſt have no power at all againſt me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſin. And from thenceforth Pilate ſought to releaſe him:</hi> here ſee</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The occaſion that moved Pilate to enquire into the divinity or divine na- of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Pilates frequent urging the innocency of Ieſus, and oft ſaying, when they ſaid <hi>crucifie him,</hi> Pilate oft would ſay, <hi>why? what hath be done?</hi> what law hath he broken? what ſhall he be condemned for? an innocent perſon ought to be releaſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This forced the Iews again, as formerly they had done, to urge their own law, which though it be not a Romane Law, yet by the Authority of that law, he ought to dye. Now whether Pilate asked them what that Law was, or whether they produced it unasked, it is not very material, ſeeing the Holy Ghoſt is ſilent in it, but they produce the effect of the law, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>we have a law, and by that Law be ought to dye, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God.</hi> This plea they formerly uſed, in the ſecond act of Pilate, and now again more fully, and this is evidently at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time attended with other circumſtances, This law of blaſpemy is the only law that they had to plead againſt him, for ſaying he is the Son of God, which is one of the greateſt and moſt glorious Truths in the world. For this, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Ieſus in their Council, and this they plead before Pilate, he ought to dy for ſaying he is the Son of God, Ieſus Chriſt was the firſt Martyr that dyed for this Truth.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:65391:52"/>3. When Pilate heard that word, that he ſaid, <hi>I am the Son of God,</hi> this word ſtartled the pagans heart, and he was more afraid He clearly ſaw his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that they perſecuted him out of envy, now if this innocent perſon ſhould be the Son of God, how ſhould I dare to put him to death? The Iews hearts were hard, their Conſciences ſeared, as hard as Rock ſtones. But Pilate a pagan was more afraid, he was afraid before, but now more afraid. what was he afraid of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? ſure he feared the guilt of innocent blood. To condemn an innocent man to dye is an abomination to God, an horrible ſin, and this he was afraid of before; but now he is more afraid, if this innocent perſon be the Son of God, his very heart twittered and ſhrunk about it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Therefore Pilate taketh Ieſus again into the <hi>Pretorium,</hi> being induſtrious to find out the matter, and that which paſſed in the <hi>Pretorium,</hi> is in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt.</hi> Pilate asked Jeſus, <hi>Whence art thou?</hi> viz, not of what Nation or Country, for he knew him to be a Jew of Galilee, but of what Original art thou? art thou the Son of God?</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt is ſilent and anſwered not,</hi> he was not ſilent in teſtifying to his Kingly and Prophetical Offices, before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.13. why then was he ſilent to teſtify to his divine nature? the reaſon is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. <hi>had the Princes of of the World known, they would not have crucifyed the Lord of glory,</hi> now Ieſus Chriſt his purpoſe was to dye. Neither yet did Ieſus Chriſt lead Pilate into ſin, though in this point he did not ſtop and prevent him; enough was ſaid and done to have ſtopped him, were it but in the clearneſs of his innocency. But it was not effectual.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Pilate was moved, offended, huffed, becauſe he would not anſwer him, nor reſpect him, but neglect him, therefore he ſpeaks big to him, <hi>what? do you not know who I am? I have power to crucifie thee, or to releaſe thee.</hi> He thought to ſcare him with ſuch vapouring words. But alas, what are his great vaporing words to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt or to his Saints? The world miſs their mark, when they think by ſuch means to prevail againſt Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Vnto this high vapouring of Pilate, Jeſus Chriſt anſwereth two things,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt. Thou couldeſt have no power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above.</hi> viz. Not from <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſo much, as he might underſtand it, but from the God of Iſrael, whom thou neither knoweſt, nor profeſſeſt to ſerve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly. For this cauſe the Jews who delivered me to thee have the greater ſin,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know God and profeſs to ſerve him, and they know the promiſes touching me, and yet they perſecute me. Thou ſinneſt, but they are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſinners.</p>
                  <p>And herein Jeſus Chriſt teſtified of his divinity before Pilate, only it was but ſubobſcurely, ſo much as in his divine wiſdome he ſaw fitting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Why did not Pilate deliver him ſeeing he vapoured ſo much of his power ſo to doe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We ſhall in this hiſtory ſee the Reaſons thereof.</p>
                  <p>So much for what paſſed between Jeſus and Pilate in the <hi>Pretorium:</hi> Now ſee what followed, in the beginning of <hi>v.</hi> 12. Pilate did not only ſuppreſs his diſguſt and diſpleaſure at the ſilence of Jeſus, but took patiently his reproof for his ſin in perſecuting him. Yea and not only ſo, but from thenceforth Pilate ſought to releaſe him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How did Pilate ſeek to releaſe him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By humane policies and Tricks, he had no better nor higher princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to act by. And this will be very obſervable, that all his humane policy and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65391:53"/> devices were not only ineffectual to his end, but drew forth the Jews to an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible increaſe of their ſins: as we ſhall ſee in the particulars. Yea and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapped himſelf alſo. Great obſervations of Inſtruction lye before us all the way. But I paſs on.</p>
                  <p>One of Pilates politick devices was, to catch them in a neceſſity to deliver Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus by their own conſent, wherein ſee,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Pilate conſidered that he muſt (either by publick Articles, or by cuſtom) deliver unto the people one priſoner, whom they ſhould chuſe, at the Feaſt of the Paſſover, and the people began to call upon him for the performance of it, <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.8. The multitude began to cry aloud that he would doe as ever he had done he took therefore that opportunity to offer unto them, to remit unto them Jeſus <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.9.10. <hi>Will you that I releaſe unto you the King of the Iews; for he knew that for envy the high Prieſts had delivered him.</hi> And Pilate uſed that word to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>the King of the Jews,</hi> as an argument perſwaſive to the people, as appears by his after arguing upon that point.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Pilate contrived to give them their choyce of one, but ſo as that they ſhould be forced to chuſe Jeſus, and ſo deliver him by their own act. Pilate would have done them good, but they would not. The way that he contrived was, to ſtreighten them in their liberty of chuſing among all the priſoners; he would give them their choice but of two, and they were Jeſus and Barrabas. Now this Barrabas was a Mutineer, a Robber, a Murderer, <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.19. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.40. But Jeſus was an innocent perſon, had done many good works a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: only the Prieſts had a ſpight and envy againſt him: and all this Pilate knew to be ſo. <hi>Math.</hi> 27.18. Therefore the Jews being a religious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and willing to be accounted ſo to be, will never chuſe Barrabas before Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. He thought verely to catch them in this Nooſe. And if they ſhould quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel him for ſtreightning their Liberty, he would ſo delay the matter, that the caſe ſhould be forced to ſtop, until after the Feaſt was over, and by that time the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r envy might be cooled. Surely this was a notable <hi>Dilemma.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But the Iews brake this net, and made nothing of it. They neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded their own Religion, nor the honour of God concerned in it. Nor did they regard the innocency of Jeſus, nor the great good works that he had done among them and for them. Nor did they regard the vileneſs of Barrabas, nor his three horrible offences that he was guilty of. Theſe Conſiderations would have moved a Pagan to a better mind; and Pilate a pagan thought ſo. But they choſe Barrabas before Jeſus, a choice that a pagan would not have made. Yea not only ſo, but they urged that Jeſus might be crucified. Though Pilate oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them ſaying, <hi>Why? what evil hath he done?</hi> Math. 27.23, Mark. 15.14. Luk. 23.22.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How came it to paſs, that the Jews a religious people, ſhould make ſuch a wicked choice, that a pagan would not have done?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> See the reaſon of it; <hi>Math.</hi> 27, 20. <hi>The chief Prieſts and Elders perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the people to ask Barrabas, and deſtroy Ieſus.</hi> So Mark. 15.11. <hi>They that led them cauſed them to erre.</hi> Iſai. 3.9. &amp; 9.16. &amp; 30.28. Ier. 23.13, 33 The world is too full of ſuch ſad examples.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee the effect of the policy of Pilate, it did more hurt then good; it drew the people into a moſt odious ſin: it layes the Jews under ignominy and diſgrace unto this day, in the eyes of all the world that hear of it.</p>
                  <p>A 2d. device ſhall I call it, or rather a prudent means Pilate uſed to qualifie
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65391:53"/> and divert their minds, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the point of their Religion, &amp; though it was not his Religion) as thus he argueth, all men know that you Jews expect a Meſſiah a Chriſt, a King, to be your Saviour and deliverer, behold he is come, this is he, and will you crucifie and kill him? and would you have me to crucifie your King?</p>
                  <p>Vnto this arguing of Pilate they return a ſad anſwer. 1. They renounce Jeſus Chriſt to be their King and Saviour. 2. They acknowledge no King but Ceſar, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.15. <hi>the chief Prieſt anſwered, we have no King but Ceſar,</hi> thus they renounce Ieſus Chriſt, yea, and the government of God, and put themſelves under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the world, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>The God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and of Jacob, the God of our Fathers hath glorified his Son Ieſus, whom ye delivered up, and denyed him in the preſence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him goe, but ye denyed the holy one, and the juſt, and deſired a Murtherer to be granted unto you, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Prince of life whom God hath raiſed from the dead, whereof we are witneſſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, further they retort and reflect the Argument upon Pilate, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.12. <hi>If you refuſe him you are no friend to Ceſar,</hi> he that maketh himſelf to be a King, is againſt Ceſar, he is the only King in the World.</p>
                  <p>Thus Pilate got a ſad blow, which wounded his very heart, and wrought a ſad effect and change in him, for this very Argument brought Pilate about, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Jeſus. They argued, if you diſmiſs him upon this point, that he is the King of the Jews, you are a Jew, and an Enemy to Ceſar, as we that oppoſe you ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans and friends to Ceſar. Thus we ſee what ill ſucceſs Pilate had in all the pains he took to deliver Jeſus Chriſt out of their hands.</p>

                  <head>So much for the ſixth act of Pilate in this ſad Court, the ſeventh act followeth, wherein finally he yieldeth to the chief Prieſts and Jews to condemn Jeſus.</head>

And it was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Paſsover, and about the ſixth hour.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt.</hi> Here we muſt firſt conſider the cauſes that moved Pilate to yield unto the high Prieſt and Jews. 1. They ſtruck him on the right vein for their purpoſe, and when they pleaded him to be no friend to Ceſar, if he releaſed Jeſus, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.12. he could not indure the impeachment of that Argument; he had rather of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, and Conſcience, or any thing, then to offend Ceſar, he muſt claw and curry favour with the Emperour, he could not bear with the breath of that Sentence, he is no friend to Ceſar, and therefore when he heard that ſaying it tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned his wheel, he yielded, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He yielded to pleaſe and content the people, <hi>Mark.</hi> 15.15. <hi>Pilate willing to content the people, releaſed Barrabas, and delivered Ieſus to them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He yielded to pleaſe the high Prieſt and people too, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.23. and the voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them and of the chief Prieſts prevailed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He yielded to prevent a tumult, which his delayes and their haſte hurryed them unto, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.24. <hi>When Pilate ſaw he could prevail nothing, but rather a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult was made,</hi> &amp;c. theſe are the cauſes expreſſed, that brought about pilate, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the firſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here is noted the place where he paſſed that black Sentence, not in the Roman judgement-Hall, but in the Jews judgement-Hall, a Romane Judge, in the Jews judgement-Hall, to ſhew their abſolute ſubjection to the Romane Yoke, and that voluntarily. <hi>The SCEPTER was departed from Iudah</hi> by their own voluntary choice, and to ſhew the concurrence both of Jews and Gentiles in the condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and crucifying of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:65391:54"/>3. The time of this act was about the beginning of the ſixth hour, the exact time of the preparation of the Paſsover Lamb, that is near noon? Then began the preparation to kill the paſcal lamb. And little did Pilate think, or the Iews re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that this perſon was the pure, innocent, ſpotleſs Lamb of God, which they were preparing to kill and Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How can this be the day and time of the Paſsover, ſeeing Ieſus Chriſt and his Diſciples kept the Paſsover yeſterday, the evening before he ſuffered?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Reverend Calvin helps me with an anſwer. The Elders had made a Tradition, that when the fourteenth day of the Moneth falleth to be the fifth day of the week, that it might be lawful for any that would, to defer the Paſsover one day, that ſo the Sabbath day might be the day after the Paſsover, that ſo that Sabbath ſhould be an high day, as the Sabbath after the ſuffering of Ieſus Chriſt was accompted to be, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.31. becauſe it was a double holy convocation, much may be ſaid about this, but I will paſs on. Now Ieſus would not keep the day allowed by Tradition, but took the day that was by inſtitution, he kept the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day. And it was a divine providence ſo to order it, &amp; this gave <hi>Iudas</hi> the opportunity to betray Ieſus Chriſt, to the Jews the day before their Paſsover, who followed the Tradition of the Fathers, and this gave the occaſion that Jeſus was crucified juſt at the time of their Paſsover, for on the ſixth day of the week about the ſixth hour, which was about noon, they began to kill Ieſus, for at or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time he was condemned by <hi>Pilate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Here was a great check given unto <hi>Pilate</hi> before he had paſſed the Sentence, hitherto he had ſtrove with the Iews (the Spirit of God in common grace aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him) to ſtop them from this abominable ſin, by behaving himſelf like a wiſe, prudent, diligent, juſt judge; yet they grew the worſe by all his pains. But at laſt they lighted on an Argument that touched him, and overcame him to do unjuſtice for the ſake of man, now God ſtrives with <hi>Pilate,</hi> that he might ſtill be valiant in doing juſtly, and not condemn the innocent, and the ſtriving of Gods Spirit was by his wives terrible meſſage ſent unto him, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.19. <hi>When he was ſet down on the Iudgment Seat, his wife ſent unto him ſaying, have thou nothing to do with that juſt man for I have ſuffered many things this day in a dream becauſe of him.</hi> where ſee 1. The time when the meſſage came, <hi>when he was ſet down on the Iudgement Seat,</hi> and making ready to pronounce the Sentence. 2. The matter of the meſſage in ſundry things</p>

                  <p n="2">2. She warneth and exhorteth <hi>Pilate</hi> her husband <hi>to have nothing to do with,</hi> or to do nothing againſt <hi>that juſt man,</hi> in judging or condemning of him to dy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Her reaſon, becauſe ſhe had ſuffered much in a dream that day about him, which had terrified her, ſtirred up her heart to ſend this ſad warning unto him, a faithful part of a wiſe good wife.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> what ſuffering could ſhe have?</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sad apprehenſions of the guilt of innocent blood, the blood of an holy, innocent, beneficent perſon, looks terribly in the face of a diſcreet, wiſe perſon, as ſhe ſeemeth to be.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How did ſhe ſuffer?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By Terrours in a divine dream, it was not a diabolical dream, Satans chief deſign was to kill Ieſus Chriſt, to bruiſe the heel of his humanity. Satan had much adoe to bring about <hi>Pilate</hi> to do it, and now that he was come about, he was hardly put to it to keep him too, to do the deed; and this check from his wife, whom he knew to be a wiſe woman, did almoſt ſhake him quite off again, there was but
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65391:54"/> one Hinge that turned him, and ſtill held him, <hi>viz.</hi> that generous principle what? ſhall I not be firm and true to my Sovereign, Satan would not have thus acted; but it was a divine dream, and the Spirit of God by common grace in the wife, ſtrove with her husband.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How came ſhe thus to have a day dream? that morning afore ſhe roſe which many times is not early with Gentlewomen, ſhe might have her dream which gaſtered her, and cauſed her to riſe and ſend to hear how things went at the Court: and being informed, that though <hi>Pilate</hi> had with much prudence and diligence carryed himſelf right, a great while, yet they had brought him about to yield to them, whereupon ſhe preſently wrote that meſſage, or delivered it to ſome fit inſtrument to deliver to <hi>Pilate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether this meſſage was openly delivered to Pilate, or whether his prudence did cauſe it to be publiſhed, it is not ſaid, but he was no doubt, willing it ſhould be publiſhed, that he might make uſe of it, if poſſible to ſtop them in their violence.</p>
                  <p>Why may we not conjecture that ſeeing, <hi>Pilate</hi> condemned Jeſus Chriſt for fear of the Emperours diſpleaſure. She might dream, that it ſhould be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with his falling into the Emperours diſpleaſure, and his baniſhment into <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> (then a barbarous Nation) where there is a Lake near <hi>Lucerna</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pilates</hi> Lake unto this day?</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <head>So much touching this divine check unto Pilate, the probable effects of this meſſage.</head>
                  <p>NOthing is expreſly ſaid to be the Effect of this meſſage, yet upon a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous weighing all the Circumſtances, we ſhall find that it ſo wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that after he was ſet down in the Judgement Seat, and had this meſſage, he doth again attempt to perſwade them by the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that he had uſed before.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He argues with them again, that he is their King, <hi>and will ye crucifie him?</hi> Joh. 19.14, 15. this point he did the more urge. Firſt, becauſe the Gentiles knew that the Jews looked for a King and Saviour. And ſecondly, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt had fully aſſerted his kingly Office before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and ſo effectually as that he did believe it, <hi>viz.</hi> with an hiſtorical Faith, which appeareth by the Title he ſet upon the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and his reſolution to aſſert it. That <hi>Pilate</hi> had uſed this point of reaſoning with them, before he yielded to them, is manifeſt, becauſe one part of their anſwer to this point put them upon that plea, that overcame <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</hi> Now after he is ſet in the judgement Seat he uſes the ſame plea again. And it puts the Jews upon the ſame dreadful anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> again to diſclaim Jeſus Chriſt from being their King, and to profeſs that they had no King but Ceſar, wherein they renounced the government of God and Chriſt, and ſubjected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the World and worldly Rulers; who have kicked them about the world in every place, ever ſince, <hi>and they put away the SCEPTER from Judah,</hi> and never had it ſince reſtored to this day. And Pilate by this their anſwer, lay open to the ſame ſnare that had taken him, and ſtill holds him, he cannot bear that word to be imputed to him, <hi>no friend to Ceſar.</hi> What? not true and conſtant to my Sovereign? let God &amp; Chriſt, &amp; Conſcience, &amp; all go, rather then unndergo that imputation.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Pilate</hi> doth now again after the meſſage received from his wife, put them upon that <hi>Dilemma,</hi> to neceſſitate them to chooſe Jeſus, or to prefer <hi>Barrabas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, which he thought the vileſt of Pagans would not do; for though they had ſo ſpoken before, yet he had not as yet granted their choice. <hi>Barrabas</hi> was not delivered to them, till at the laſt, as we ſhall ſee; for in ſuch order <hi>Mathew</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:65391:55"/> doth relate them. And it app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>areth that Pilate urged his Arguments over and over, for ſo he doth inculcate that point ſundry times, when they cryed out, <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him, crucifie him, Pilate anſwered, why? what evil hath he done?</hi> and thus <hi>Pilate</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued to the laſt. When the Prieſts perſwaded the people to ask <hi>Barrabas,</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late anſwered, <hi>what ſhall I do with Ieſus, they ſay crucify him? Pilate ſaith again, why? what evil hath he done?</hi> which they had nothing to reply unto him but will and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, the reurging of thoſe points, ſeem to be the Effect of the meſſage that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates wiſe had ſent unto him.</p>
                  <p>Yet again before he would doe the wicked Fact, he had one device more, wherby he hoped either to appeaſe their minds, or if not to aſſert his own innocency, and to teſtifie againſt them. He calleth for water in their ſight, and waſheth his hands with a proteſtation of his innocency, in this horrid fact of ſhedding the blood of ſuch an innocent perſon. But alas <hi>Pilate,</hi> why then did you doe the deed? This is but a poor excuſe to you, though a convinſing Argument to them, that the Judge ſhould ſo ſtedfaſtly proteſt the innocency of Jeſus Chriſt, whom they out of envy perſecuted to the death.</p>
                  <p>They ſtill are in fear that <hi>Pilate</hi> would ſhrink from the work, and not finiſh that which they hoped they had entangled him to doe. And becauſe they ſaw that he was ſo deeply affected with the guilt of the innocent blood of Jeſus, they endavoured to eaſe his mind as much as in them lay of that terror &amp; fear. Therefore they doe in a moſt dreadfull manner take the guilt of his blood upon themſelves, and thereby, as much as in them lay, to acquit <hi>Pilate,</hi> to uphold his recoiling heart to the work, till he had done it, and to ſhew their confidence in the caſe, and harden Pilates heart, they involve their Children in the guilt of his blood. Why did they ſo? did not their Fathers cavill againſt God, for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their childrens teeth on edge, when their Fathers had eaten ſower grapes? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.2, 3, 4. But mad envy, pride and paſſion, are cruel, bloudy, confident, though ſhut up in blindneſs and violent ignorance.</p>
                  <p>It is the ſaddeſt curſe, that ever parents, ſince the fall of Adam, brought upon their Children: it lyeth upon them to this day. Thus all the politick devices that this witty ingenious man could deviſe, did them no good, but much hurt, putting them upon horrid ſins, and violence, almoſt to Rebellion and Arms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly.</hi> Pilate ſhutteth up and finiſheth this ſad Court with four Acts, not of juſtice, but of foul injuſtice and cruelty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He delivereth to them <hi>Barrabas,</hi> not acted till now, an act abominable to God, to juſtifie the wicked, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He paſſeth Sentence of Condemnation to the Croſs upon Jeſus Chriſt; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt abominable act. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He ſcourgeth Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond time: for this ſcourging was at and upon his condemnation. <hi>Math.</hi> 27.26. <hi>&amp; Mar.</hi> 15.15. His former ſcourging was when Herod ſent him back to Pilate. Pilate told the Jews, he would ſcourge him and releaſe him. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.16, 22. And he did ſo. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.1. but did not releaſe him. And now again upon his Condemnation, he ſcourges him upon his ſore wounded back. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 129.3. Now the plowers made deep and long their furrows on his back.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He delivered him into their hands to crucifie him. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.16. <hi>Math.</hi> 27.26 <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.15. Yea, (which is to be marvelled at) he delivered him (not to juſtice) but to their will. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.25. whoſe wills how evill they were, Pilate ſaw.</p>

               <p n="1">1. They made him to carry his own Croſs, upon which he was to be put to death, which was as much diſgrace and rigour as they were in a capacity to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe againſt him. They had but little time, and were in great haſte, which ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their rigorous dealings. Herein Ieſus Chriſt did ſuperabundantly anſwer the Type in Iſaac, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.6. who carryed on his back the wood wherewith he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was to be ſacrificed, but that was without any rigour. Jeſus Chriſt carryed the Tree on his back, with all rigour they could inflict, on which he was crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.17. he meekly took up his Croſs, according to his doctrine which he taught the Church, he now teacheth by his Example, added to his precept.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They led him betwixt two theeves, Malefactors juſtly condemned, to add diſgrace unto him, as if he were a Malefactor like them. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.32. As they placed them in the execution, ſo did they in leading them. Jeſus was placed in the middle, and the theeves, one at his right hand, and the other at his left, he in the middle, as the worſt of them all.</p>

And they had made our Lord Jeſus to carry his croſs untill he was out of the city; ſo long as he was able to doe it. His body was macerated by the loſs of blood, in his two whippings, and twice crowning with Thorns, with want of reſt and ſuſtenance for ſo long a time. His ſtraining under an heavy burden, would rend and tear his wounded back and head, with great pain and torment, which would diſable him from going ſo faſt as they (being in haſt) would have him go: It is like alſo, that they had made his croſs lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then others, that they might advance him higher, and more viſible to all. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

               <p>But here we may conſider three things, which I propoſe under ſubmiſſion to better judgments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Simon did valiantly refuſe, and oppoſe to joyn with them, he would have no hand in ſo cruel and unjuſt a murther, and ſo far refuſed as to give ſufficient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that he did diſclaim and condemn their fact which they were about to execute.</p>

               <p n="3">3. No doubt he ſaw that it was a work of pitty, mercy and love to Jeſus Chriſt to eaſe, releive and help him in undergoing their rigor (it may be Jeſus ſaid to him, Help me) with that heart and mind he ſet to his ſhoulder, hitched it on upon his own ſhoulder, to give unto Jeſus Chriſt all the eaſe he could.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, that theſe acts of grace in Simon were highly accepted of God, and well pleaſing to Jeſus Chriſt, which may appear by theſe things recorded in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this act is recorded in Scripture, by three evangelical Witneſſes, <hi>Mat. Mar. Luk.</hi> As Jeſus ſaid of that good woman that ointed his feet, <hi>Math.</hi> 26 13.

We ſee alſo what an holy compellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he giveth them, <hi>Ye Daughters of Ieruſalem,</hi> that is ye children of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. See the matter of his ſpeech unto them and to all the Auditory in four Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Weep not for me,</hi> that is not only for me: it is a [not] comparative, <hi>viz.</hi> not ſo much, or not only for me; for I ſhall tell you of another object of your weeping and lamentation. He doth not forbid them weeping for him, much leſs doth he check or blame them for it, but he informeth them of another object to weep for, beſides him. You now weep becauſe of my death this day, but I tell you of that which ſhall be the effect and puniſhment of that which is done this day in putting me to death. Jeruſalem ſhall ſmart for what they doe this day, and when that day of vengeance is come, there will be other matter of weeping then yet you ſee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Weep for your ſelves and for your children:</hi> weep both for the preſent Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and for the riſing Generations. Look not only on preſent things, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what your preſent actions do portend and threaten to bring upon you. And did you but conſider what puniſhment, Calamityes and miſeryes this dayes act will bring upon Ieruſalem, you would then ſee that there is great cauſe to weep for your ſelves, and for your children, as well as for me.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Jeſus Chriſt gives them a Reaſon why they ſhould weep for themſelves and for their Children; <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe of thoſe terrible days that are coming upon them, which are deſcribed, <hi>Firſt.</hi> By that uſual note of attention, <hi>Behold,</hi> ſhewing the certainty of ſuch calamityes coming on them, and the terribleneſs thereof, in both

Thoſe terrible effects of the calamity of thoſe dayes are two. <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They ſhall bleſs the barr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n woman, womb, &amp; dry breaſts, it was a reproach in Iſrael to be barren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.25. but now they ſhall count them happy that have no children to ſee and feel theſe bitter calamityes, the words imply that it is a curſe and miſery to have Children to be ſufferers of theſe calamityes, which is an Argument to prove that theſe calamityes will be great, yea, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great; the conſideration whereof doth ſhew that you have cauſe to weep for your ſelves, and for your Children, as well as for me.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Effect will be, that they ſhall be in ſuch deſperation, that they ſhall wiſh <hi>the mountains to fall on them, and the hills to cover them,</hi> which is a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſſion of deſperation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.15, 16, 17. deſperation is one of hell Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Such terrible dayes are coming on you and your Children, which ſhould cauſe you to weep for your ſelves and for your Children, as well as for me.</p>
                  <p>And all this Jeſus Chriſt doth foretel them, with an heart more bleeding with compaſſion, over them his dying Church, then over his own dying body, now bleeding with Furrows on his back, and thorny wounds on his head, and therefore exhorts them to add this ditty unto their preſent mournings for him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He gives a demonſtrative reaſon, that ſuch at leaſt, if not far worſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes ſhall ſurely come upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they add unto all their wrath provoking ſins, this laſt and greateſt, in putting to death ſo unjuſtly, ſo cruelly the Lord of glory, the Son of God mightily proved ſo to be, by many miracles done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, &amp; their own King Saviour, &amp; Meſſiah. Which ſins do ripen them for wrath, as dry wood is fitted and prepared for the fire. This reaſon is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with deep and elegant wiſdome, ſo as that the Enemies could not eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it, or apply it, ſo as to ſtop them in their way, or hinder them from put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to death; becauſe that was the work which Jeſus Chriſt did willingly expoſe himſelf unto, being that, upon which the ſalvation of Gods Elect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth. Thus Jeſus Chriſt expreſſeth this reaſoning, if they execute theſe cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes upon me an innocent perſon, as unmeet for ſuch puniſhments, as green wood for the fire. Then what ſhal befal them? who are by this ſin, added to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſins, fully ripe for wrath, as dry wood is fitted for the fire. He doth not ſay how hot the fire ſhall be, but he ſaith, <hi>what ſhall be done to the dry?</hi> to ſhew that their miſery ſhall be unexpreſſible, yea, unconceivable</p>

This Title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jeſus was crucified was nigh to the City, and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latine.

                  <p>The place out of which they lead him was the City, that he might fulfil the Types of Scriptures, that he might be a ſin offering, to cleanſe away the ſins of the people.</p>
                  <p>The manner of his going was bearing his Croſs, bearing the imputation, the guilt, and the reproach of ſin, and the curſe of God for it, ſignified by his hanging on a Tree.</p>
                  <p>The place whither they carry him is <hi>Golgotha, the place of a ſcull,</hi> where many dead mens bones wereſome heaped up, ſome ſcattered about, and that made the place ceremonially unclean, and that gave name to the place. And as it was cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monially a filthy place, ſo civilly it was no better, a place of reproach, diſgrace, diſhonour, a place where the worſt and vileſt malefactors were puniſhed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, the filthieſt place in the world. There our Lord Jeſus ſuffered the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of our ſin, ſhewing us the juſt deſert of our ſin.</p>
                  <p>When they were come to <hi>Golgotha,</hi> before they laid hands on the bleſſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Lord Jeſus, they made preparation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They ſet up the Croſſes,</hi> the Croſs of Jeſus they ſet in the midſt, and the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, one on the right hand, the other on the left, yet ſet his Croſs in the chief place, as the greateſt Malefactor: which though they did it out of envy to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace him in the vileſt manner they could, yet God permitted it ſo to be done out of infinite wiſdome and juſtice. For by imputation he was the greateſt of ſinners, ſeeing all ſin met in him, was laid upon him, and laid to his charge, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. Their Croſſes were ſet ſo near together that they could all ſpeak to each other, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the ſequel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They affixed a Title at the top of Jeſus Chriſt his Croſs, to ſhew the cauſe for which he dyed, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.37. <hi>and Mark.</hi> 15.26. whether they did ſo to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it it is not ſaid, but ſo they did to Ieſus Chriſt, and this matter Pilate ordered and over-ruled. And it being an eminent part of the Hiſtory, noted by all the Evangeliſts, and notified all the world over, I ſhall therefore diſtinctly ſet down the Hiſtory of it in ſeven particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The author, actor and doer of it, was Pilate, had it been in the power of the Prieſts it ſhould have been other then it was, as we ſhall ſee in the Hiſtory of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He poſitively aſſerts and proclaimeth him to be the King of the Iews, that is Chriſt the Meſſiah, and Saviour of the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He doth make this proclamation to all the World, in theſe three moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral known languages. <hi>Hebrew, Greek, Latine;</hi> one or other of which moſt men knew.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The nearneſs of that populous and frequented City <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> gave opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to many of all Nations to read this Title. So that the ſame thereof was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to all the World, and by this it appeareth that it was inſcribed with great and legible Letters, which might be ſeen and read at a diſtance.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This inſcription was a ſharp and ſore rebuke to the Iews, to the high Prieſts, Scribes, and Phariſees, that they ſhould crucifie their own Lord, Saviour, and King, whom they looked for to redeem Iſrael, but they looked with a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided Eye, and therefore knew him not.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They felt the ſting of this rebuke, and winched at it, they were diſpleaſed, and requeſted Pilate that it might be altered, which might eaſily be done by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a word or two, <hi>viz.</hi> he ſaith <hi>I am King of the Iews,</hi> but that word would have quite altered the ſenſe and the truth.</p>

                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:65391:58"/>7. Pilate was reſolute and unmoveable, <hi>What I have written, I have written,</hi> and this reſolution of his ſeemeth to be well grounded.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Becauſe he was convinced of the Truth of it, for Ieſus Chriſt had fully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted to him his kingly Office &amp; Pilate with an hiſtorical Faith believed it.</item>
                     <item>2. He ſaw that the Iews needed ſuch a check, who had forced him to do that which he had no heart to have done, only by his reſpect to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> they intrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Thus we ſee Chriſt made a Sin-offering, carried out of the city, and ſetteth up the banner of Salvation in <hi>Golgotha:</hi> and <hi>Golgotha</hi> was the firſt place where the Grace and Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt was moſt ſolemnly publiſhed to all nations, in the moſt general known languages: Ye Pilate is a reſolute publiſher of the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt.

                  <p>MAth. 27.34, 35, 36. <hi>They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with Gall: and when he had taſted thereof, he would not drink. And they crucified him and parted his Garments, caſting Lots, that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet, They parted my garment among them, and upon my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture did they caſt lots. And ſitting down, they watched him there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they had made all things ready, they laid hands on his bleſſed Perſon, and the firſt thing they did was, they gave him the cup of death to drink, which he taſted, ſaith Mathew, but refuſed to drink, <hi>viz.</hi> a draught of it, ſaith Mark. A taſt of that cup was enough. That he ſhould taſte death, this was a ſignificant act, which reſpects all that followed. This is the Preface of death, put for the whole. This is that Cup of which Jeſus Chriſt ſpake before, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.22, 23. <hi>Can ye drink of the Cup that I ſhall drink?</hi> namely this cup of death, <hi>and be baptized with the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme that I ſhall be baptized with? viz.</hi> with mine own blood running down my face from the wounds which my thorny crowns cauſed. This is the cup that Iohn ſpeaketh of, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.11. <hi>The Cup which my Father giveth me to drink, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> And this he ſpeaketh to quiet Peter, when he would have fought for him. This is the cup that he had prayed thrice a little before, that it might paſs from him. <hi>Math.</hi> 26, 39.40. but he ſubmitted to his fathers will, and now behold he taſteth of it. It is the preface, and firſt act of his death. The matter of this cup, ſaith Mathew, was vinegar and gall. <hi>Math.</hi> 27.34. <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.23. ſaith <hi>Wine mixed with mirrhe,</hi> all is one, for vinegar is ſower wine, and that mixed with gall or mirrhe, or with both. It ſeems it was the Romane manner of executing Malefactors, for <hi>Iob.</hi> 19.29. There was a veſſel of ſuch liquor ready. Whether it was in favour, or rigour and terror, it is not ſaid, but ſure they did nothing in favour to Jeſus Chriſt, and Chriſt doth bitterly complain of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.21. as we ſhall afterwards ſee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The time that this act of death was done unto our Lord Jeſus, in giving him the cup of death, was at the beginning of the ſixth hour, <hi>Mark.</hi> 15.25 ſaith it was the third hour, but that maketh no difficulty, it is eaſily reconciled, for at the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65391:59"/> end of the third hour, the ſixth hour began, and that laſted till the ninth hour; ſo the Jews, they divided the time of the day. And that Mark ſo intended, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, becauſe at this very inſtant when they give the cup of death unto Jeſus Chriſt, the Sun bluſhed, and hid his face under a black vaile of darkneſs, as being aſhamed to look upon this abominable act, that theſe wicked men were about; and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act time of the beginning of this darkneſs is expreſsly ſaid to be at the beginning of the ſixth hour, <hi>Math.</hi> 27, 45. <hi>Mark</hi> 15.33. This darkening of the Sun was a divine and miraculous Teſtimony from God againſt this wicked faſt, which one would think might have terrified them from proceeding, but ſeared Conſciences feel nothing. This darkneſs was not an Ecclipſe of the Sun, by the interpoſition of the Moon, becauſe it was the middle of the Moneth, and the Moon was about the Full. Again, it was not a natural Ecclipſe, becauſe this darkneſs laſted three hours, which never any natural Ecclipſe did, or can do. Beſides, Ecclipſes are unperceivable at the beginning and end, but this darkneſs began as it ſeemeth to me in its height and ſo continued at the ſame height, from the beginning to the end. When they began, and gave Jeſus Chriſt the Cup of death, it grew ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly dark, and about the time that Jeſus Chriſt dyed it was light again, both the periods of the darkneſs were eminently obſervable. It was not a total darkneſs as night is, by the abſence of the Sun, for it is ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 29.20. many did read the ſuperſciption upon the Croſs of Ieſus Chriſt. Alſo Ieſus ſaw his mother and the Diſciple whom Ieſus loved ſtanding by her, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.26. and Ieſus ſaw the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers dividing his garments, and caſting lots on his veſture, as the Propheſy intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.18. It was an extraordinary and amazing darkneſs, to reprehend their violent, cruel, and bloody act, which they were doing, in laying hands upon the ſpotleſs Lamb of God; <hi>it was the hour and power of darkneſs</hi> wherein the Prince of darkneſs had got down the Lord of glory under his mercyleſs hands. It was an univerſal darkneſs; for if the body of the Sun be darkened, the Moon and Stars that receive their light therefrom, muſt needs be alſo in a like proportion dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; obſcured. Some holy Divines ſay that this darkning of the ſun, was a viſible ſign of Gods deſertion, and hiding his face from Jeſus Chriſt all the time of his ſuffering upon the Croſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The wicked Murderers are undaunted, they goe on with their work they had in hand, they ſtrip off his garments, and crucifie him naked, (unleſs they had ſo much modeſty as to cover ſhame) for all the Evangeliſts put the parting of his garments, at or about the beginning of the time of his hanging o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. They lifted him up on high, that they might faſten him to the croſs. This was typified by lifting up the brazen ſerpent in the wilderneſs, as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf teſtifieth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.14. <hi>As Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up.</hi> Ioh. 8.28. <hi>When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then ſhall ye know that I am he.</hi> Ioh. 12.32, 33. <hi>I, when I am lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me.

Where we have to conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His own act of forgiving them is implyed in an eminency, in his applying himſelf to his Father to pardon them. As Jeſus Chriſt hath taught us to forgive our Brother, yea our enemies; ſo he himſelf doth practice at this eminent time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He prayes the Father to forgive them, which he could not have done, unleſs he himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad forgiven them: for their offence was againſt both Father and ſon, and therefore both muſt concur in the pardon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He urges the Father with a charitable and compaſſionate reaſon, becauſe alas, they are in a Temptation, and know not what they do.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Lord doth herein with divine wiſdome diſtinguiſh, <hi>viz,</hi> that there be two ſorts among his perſecutors. Some, we have cauſe to fear, did know what they did, as appears, <hi>Math.</hi> 21.38, <hi>this is the heir come let us kill him, and the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhall be ours.</hi> Such as ſo acted are not within the compaſs of Ieſus Chriſt his pardon and prayer.</p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:65391:60"/>
                  <p>But the generality of the people acted even as they were led, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. and they did like thoſe that followed <hi>Abſolom,</hi> in the ſimplicity of their hearts, now ſuch as thoſe Jeſus Chriſt doth pitty, pardon, and pray for. The chief Prieſts &amp; Council did know, or might have known that he was Chriſt the Son of the living God; for beſides all the proofs that he gave of it, in his life and Miniſtry, by doctrine and fulfilling Propheſies, and abundance of miracles, yet they raged againſt him, and reſolved to kill him, and when they could find no cauſe againſt him, they put him upon it to confeſs whether he was the Son of God, or no, he did plainly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs a good confeſſion, that he is the Meſſiah, and for that confeſſion only, and for no other cauſe, ſaving their own envy they did condemn him to dye, and reſted not till they had accompliſhed it. Theſe things being ſo, it is hard for us to ſay, that theſe are of the number of thoſe that knew not what they did. But the people for the moſt part were over perſwaded by them, &amp; in their ignorance acted. Pilate alſo was ignorant of his Diety, though he believed with an hiſtorical faith that he was the King of the Jews, and had he known his Deity, <hi>he would not have crucifyed him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. So that Jeſus Chriſt hath opened a dore of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to his perſecutors. The Centurion that had the command of the watch that day, and how many more God knows, did that very day receive benefit of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and prayer of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond act of Jeſus Chriſt upon the Croſs, he doth with tender love and care provide for his widow mother, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.25, 26, 27. <hi>Now there ſtood by the Croſs of Jeſus, his mother, and his mothers ſiſter, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene. When Jeſus therefore ſaw his mother, and the Diſciple ſtanding by, whom he loved, he ſaith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy Son. Then ſaith he to the Diſciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour that Diſciple took her unto his own home.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where ſee, 1. The title he giveth his mother, <hi>[woman]</hi> which he was wont to do upon occaſion formerly <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.4. which he doth, not ſhewing any ſtrangeneſs or diſregard of her grief, whoſe heart was now pierced as with a ſword, but he did it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To take her heart off from all carnal confidence, in her fleſhly intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt: to put her to conſider that her paps are more bleſſed by her intereſt of ſaith in Jeſus Chriſt, then in giving him ſuck. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.27.28.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To inſtruct her and us, that though there be uſe of natural Relations in this life, yet it is not ſo in heaven. <hi>Math.</hi> 22.30. We ſhall there be as the Angels are. Spiritual weanings from creature confidences, are no hurt unto, or hindrances of right natural affections.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He directs his mother to chuſe an adopted ſon in his room who is now departing that he may be unto her in the ſtead of her natural Son, to doe all offices of a Son unto her. He ſaith to her, <hi>Behold thy ſon,</hi> intimating to her John that was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by her.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He inſtructeth and chargeth John to doe all offices of a good Son unto her ſaying to him, <hi>Behold thy mother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. This charge is ſet on, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt did thus dignifie him out of ſpecial favour and love. <hi>The Diſciple whom be loved.</hi> And therefore he might confide in him in committing ſuch a truſt and charge unto him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The effect of this act of Ieſus Chriſt was, from that hour he took her into his own Family, which proveth that ſhe was a widdow, and had not a family of her own, now her Son was gone. When Ioſeph died, or what became of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, nothing is ſaid</p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:65391:60"/>
                  <p>The third act of Ieſus Chriſt upon the Croſs, he taketh a mercifull care of the penitent Thief. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.39, 40, 41, 42, 43. <hi>And one of the Malefactors which were hanged, railed on him, ſaying, if thou be Chriſt, ſave thy ſelf and us. But the other anſwering rebuked him, ſaying, doſt thou not fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnaion? And we indeed juſtly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds, but this man hath done nothing amiſs. And he ſaid unto Ieſus, Lord remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdome. And Ieſus ſaid unto him, verily I ſay unto thee, To day ſhall thou be with me in Paradice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where ſee, among the Mockers, Revilers, Railers againſt Ieſus Chriſt on the croſs, one of the Theeves did as he heard others doe, though he was hanging on his croſs under the hand of juſtice and Execution. Mathew and Mark impute this to both the Melefactors, becauſe what one in a company doth, is in uſual cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome imputed to all, unleſs they bear witneſs againſt it. And whether at firſt or by the way, both of them might be acceſſary, we cannot ſay; but Luke is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in this hiſtory, ſhewing that one of them was a true penitent:</p>
                  <p>Where 1. we ſee what his ill words are that are recorded, viz. <hi>if thou be the Chriſt, ſave thy ſelf and us.</hi> wherein he vents his unbelief and hardneſs of heart, in way of reproach. This he doth when he was dying, yea a ſhamefull death, and that juſtly, yet ſo ill minded is he againſt Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His fellow thief rebuked him, whereby he cleared himſelf from participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him in his ſin, which ſilence in ſuch a caſe doth involve men in. In which Rebuke ſee,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doſt thou not fear God?</hi> The words of thy mouth ſhew that the fear of God is not in thine heart, therefore ſpeak not ſo wickedly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He giveth a reaſon of this Rebuke and exhortation, becauſe we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dye as he is, we are in the ſame condemnation. They are executing death upon us, and doſt thou now vent the vileneſs of thine heart againſt him that is dying with us?</p>

All ſorts of them did mock, flout, inſult, blaſpheme, <hi>Mathew, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> do record it, and ſhew what every ſort ſaid, and did.</p>

               <p>The ſenſe of cruel pain that his body was in all this while may in a ſmall meaſure be apprehended by what hath been ſaid in the particular Tortures.</p>
               <p>The ſufferings of his mind by the reproaches, mocks, blaſphemies, taunts, which he heard and ſaw all this while of his ſilence, theſe were a bitter part of his ſuffering as it is expreſſed in the Propheſy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.20. <hi>reproach hath broken my heart, and I am full of heavineſs, and I lookod for ſome to take pitty, but there was none, &amp; comforters but found none,</hi> vineger and gall was all that the creatures afford him, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. The cauſes of this affliction of his mind are expreſſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. by three words, reproach, ſhame and diſhonour, which are ſaid to have this effect upon him, <hi>reproach hath broken my heart,</hi> an heart wound is deeper and more terrible then a bodily wound, ungrateful men pierced and wounded his heart, when he was dying for them. Ovile ingratitude, O infinite patience and pitty! the tongues of men did pierce Jeſus Chriſt to the heart, as he hung upon the Croſs, they ſo fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his heart with heavineſs, that there was no room for comfort. When he looked for ſome to pitty, and bemoan him, or help him, but there was none that had power to help him, his mother and John ſtood by, and many more no doubt, but alas they could not help him, <hi>be trade the wine preſs alone, Iſai.</hi> 63.3.</p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:65391:62"/>
               <p>There is a threefold wounding of the heart by words. 1. A penitential piercing of the heart by words of conviction. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.2.37. this is a bleſſed goſpel wound.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a wrathfull cutting of the heart when reproofs are applyed, as <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 54. this is a ſinfull wound. But 3. There is a ſorrowfull piercing of the heart by words of reproach, and this was the heart-breaking ſorrow that Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered upon the Croſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But can the words of a man ſo pierce the innocent heart of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt ſtood in the ſtead of thoſe that were guilty, and therefore divine juſtice ſet them home to his heart to the uttermoſt. None can tell the force of words till he have experienced the ſame. Words are the means whereby Souls have converſe and communion. Words carry the mind, heart, judgement, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, affection, paſſion of one party to another. If we uſe Gods words, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them right, they both wound and heal, and are moſt wholſome. But they were mens words that broke the heart of Ieſus Chriſt. When words flow from anger, envy, hatred wrath, revenge, ſuch words are full of the breath and ſpirit of Satan and make cruel wounds upon the heart: and ſuch wounds were made in the heart of Ieſus Chriſt. Some ſorts of wounding words did eſpecially pierce the heart of Ieſus Chriſt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. When they upbraided him, <hi>Where is thy God? Pſal.</hi> 42.3, 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.45 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.7.</p>

               <p>Among ungratefull men, abuſers of Ieſus Chriſt, two men are to be wondered at, and they are Iudas and Malchus.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The hiſtory of the three hours darkneſs, which was the time, moſt of it of Jeſus Chriſt his ſilence, wherein his ſoul did agonize under the puniſhment of our ſin, which puniſhment was extended to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, even untill juſtice was fully ſatiſtied.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. The fourth and laſt dying word which Jeſus Chriſt ſpake, was, <hi>Into thy hands I commit my Spirit,</hi> and with that word breathed out his Soul.</p>
                  <p>Sundry remarkable effects of his death, of which in their place.</p>
                  <p>In this ſilent agony of Jeſus Chriſt upon the croſs, he ſuffered all the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and curſe which ſin hath brought upon man, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>he was made a curſe for us,</hi> viz. by ſuffering all the puniſhment of the curſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He was made ſin for us,</hi> viz. an Offering to bear the guilt and puniſhment of ſin, though he knew not ſin, ſo as to doe it. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. This whole famous Propheſie, declareth this great point, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.26. <hi>whom thou haſt ſmitten. Col.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Having made peace by the blood of his croſs.</hi> 1. Cor. 15.3, 4. <hi>Chriſt dyed for our ſins occording to the Scriptures</hi> Dan 9.24. <hi>He hath made an end of ſin,</hi> viz. He hath ſatiſfied juſtice for the firſt ſin of Adam, and for all ſin that hath followed from the ſame. He hath taken away the condemning power of ſin, by the authority of the Law, and brought it under another law or Covenant, viz. of Grace. The firſt Covenant of works doth not over-rule ſin, in its condemning power; but Jeſus Chriſt doth over-rule it by the New Covenant, under which he doth rule all the Elect of God. And that he might accompliſh all this, he hath ſuffered all the eſſential puniſhment of the curſe, <hi>viz.</hi> all ſinleſs puniſhment, all that the juſtice of the law requireth, &amp; with his ſufferings juſtice was fully ſatisfied, and all this he ſuffered for us. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.3, 4, 5, 6. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There be ſome accidental parts and points of puniſhment, which fall upon man but cannot fall upon Ieſus Chriſt, which I will touch in a few inſtances.</p>
                  <p>Inſtance 1. Eternity of puniſhment befals man, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.41, 46. <hi>Everlaſting fire, Everlaſting puniſhment,</hi> Mark. 9.44, 45, 46, 48. <hi>the worm dyeth not, nor is the fire quenched.</hi> But this is ſo, becauſe of the inability of a finite Creature to ſatisfie infinite juſtice. But Jeſus Chriſt is God-man, and therefore he is able to ſatisfie infinite juſtice in a finite time, becauſe he is an infinite perſon, and therefore his ſufferings are of infinite value, his ſufferings make up in value, what they be ſhort in time of duration. He ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fered infinite puniſhment, wrath and curſe, in a finite ſhort time. As the firſt Adam if he had ſtood, though a finite perſon, ſhould have finiſhed perfect active obedience to the Law, in a finite time, becauſe he was a perſon fitly qualified by God, for ſuch a ſervice, being furniſhed with the perfect image of God. So the ſecond Adam did in a finite time finiſh all obedience to the Law, both active and pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſive, and fulfilled our Covenant of works, being an infinite perſon, and infinitely qualified for that work, having the Spirit without meaſure, an infinite perſon ſuffered &amp; obeyed ſatisfactorily, in a finite time, he had Gods image perfectly, and therefore perfectly fitted and qualified for that great work. Thirty three years and an half were requiſite, wherein Jeſus Chriſt might perform and fulfil perfect obedience to the Law, both active and paſſive; and perform all that which Juſtice did require at the hand of man.</p>
                  <p>The middle part of his pilgrimage had leſs of paſſive, and more exerciſed in active obedience, the beginning and end of his life were more filled with ſufferings; though every act of Jeſus Chriſt had both active and paſſive obedience in it, yet
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65391:63"/> one, ſometimes more illuſtrious then the other. From his entrance into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, till he dyed, was about twenty hours, or near ſo much, and that was the chiefeſt time of his ſuffering Torment; but his humiliation continued his whole life through. And when Jeſus Chriſt did dye, if he had dyed eternally, then d ath had overcome him. But he hath overcome death, and ſaw not corruption though he dyed, becauſe he roſe again the third day.</p>
                  <p>Inſtance 2. The place of mans ſuffering Torment is Hell, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.23. <hi>and in Hell he lift up his eyes, being in Torment.</hi> But Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered all his ſufferings on Earth, how then did he ſuffer all the puniſhment due to man?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a penal Hell, and local Hell, penal hell hath two branche

                     </gap> ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>And whereſoever theſe two are inflicted, there is penal hell, though it be not in local Hell. Theſe two kinds of puniſhment are chiefly inflicted on the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in local Hell, ſometimes a good meaſure of it in this life. But on Jeſus Chriſt all was inflicted on Earth, where ſin is committed. And great reaſons might be offered why it muſt be ſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The place of puniſhment is not of the Eſſence, or an Eſſential part of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſin; the judge may chuſe and appoint the place, where the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be inflicted and executed. It was an act of Gods infinite wiſdome to appoint and order that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſuffer the puniſhment of ſin in this world among men, it is moſt agreeable to the Covenant of works that it ſhould be ſo; it is great love to his Elect that it is ſo, it is not yet revealed where the place of Hell is, or ſhall be. Some great divines have thought, that after the day of Judgement, the Earth ſhall be the place of Hell, that the place of committing ſin, ſhall be the place of puniſhing of it. Sure it was ſo with Jeſus Chriſt, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the puniſhment of ſin on Earth, where ſin was committed.</p>
                  <p>Inſtance 3. It is a great part of the puniſhment of ſin, inflicted on man, that he is dead in ſin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 5. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. one part of this dying, is to be dead in ſin. But this death Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered not, how then did he ſuffer all the puniſhment of ſin?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To be dead in ſin is perſonal defilement, by the loſs of Gods image, this could not befal Jeſus Chriſt, God hath excepted ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. Jeſus Chriſt his humane nature was like unto us in all things, except ſin, he could not ſin, therefore he could not be dead in ſin, he was every way fitted to be a ſacrifice for ſin, and he did dye for ſin without any defilement by it. He dyed for ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie juſtice, if he had dyed in ſin, he ſhould have offended Juſtice thereby, and then how ſhould he have ſatisfied Juſtice. The Lamb of God, that was to be a ſacrifice for ſin, was to be ſpotleſs and without blemiſh, had he dyed in ſin, he ſhould have been a ſpotted ſacrifice, and unaccepted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which Jeſus Chriſt could neither be, do, nor ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Lamb that ſuffered for ſin, to take it away, muſt himſelf be without ſin, and muſt ſuffer only that which he is capable to ſuffer without ſin. To ſatisfie juſtice for ſin, by dying for ſin, that was the work which Jeſus Chriſt performed, and Juſtice was ſatisfied with it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To be dead in ſin, final ſeparation from God, deſperation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65391:64"/> nor the work which he had undertaken, could admit any ſuch thing to befal him. But all the Eſſential puniſhment due to the ſin of man, he was willing to ſuffer to the utmoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. and did ſo, to the full ſatisfaction of Juſtice. Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that he ſhould dye; but did not require that he ſhould ſin, nor did Iuſtice require that he ſhould dye eternally; if he have once paid the debt of death, Iuſtice was ſatisfied, and gave him a diſcharge, that he might riſe a Conqueror.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There have been four wayes of the production of man. 1. Adam was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, out of the duſt, and he was made ſpotleſs. 2dly. <hi>Eve</hi> was created by God out of the rib of man, and ſhe was made ſpotleſs, though the weaker veſſel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All the ſtock of mankind are produced by the conjunction of man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and all defiled with ſin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Ieſus Chriſt was produced of a woman without man, by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, and he is ſpotleſs, full of grace and truth, and hereby was a capable ſubject to have ſin imputed to him, and to be made a ſacrifice to God for ſin. Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered all ſinleſs puniſhment. But when ſin is puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſin, that puniſhment Ieſus Chriſt is uncapable to ſuffer, nor is it a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary kind of puniſhment, to be ſuffered in way of ſatisfaction for ſin. Becauſe it is ſecondary, a conſequent of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Inſtance 4. Man is puniſhed with total and final ſeparation from God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. Ieſus Chriſt was not ſo puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered dereliction, and ſeparation from God, (as we ſhall anon ſee) to the utmoſt that was poſſible and neceſſary, for the ſatisfaction of Juſtice, but total and final was neither neceſſary nor poſſible; and had it been ſo, then ſin and death had overcome him. But he hath overcome ſin and death, and ſatisfied juſtice, which could not have been, if he had totally and finally ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>

                  <p>THe Eſſential parts of the ſinleſs puniſhment of ſin, which Jeſus Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffered, are two, the puniſhment of loſs, and the puniſhment of ſenſe, which appeareth, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.41, 46. <hi>depart ye curſed into Everlaſting fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The puniſhment of loſs firſtly, chiefly falleth upon the Soul, which nextly hath communion with God, and the body herein ſuffereth ſecondarily, by participation, and ſympathy with the Soul, as it was in the garden, where the body was under no ſenſe of puniſhment ſaving by participation with the Soul, and that was ſo deep, that it made him ſweat drops like blood abundantly. So that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of loſs is a Soul Agony.</p>
                  <p>The puniſhment of ſenſe doth firſtly, nextly fall upon the body, and reacheth to the Soul ſecondarily, by its participation with the body. The efficacy of both theſe together met upon Jeſus Chriſt, when he was upon the Croſs, to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extremity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> the puniſhment of loſs, deſertion, and dereliction of God fell upon him, and he conflicted with it in his three hours ſilence. The iſſue, up-ſhot, laſt ſtroak, and finiſhing whereof, Jeſus Chriſt uttered and expreſſed in that <hi>exclamatory, roaring, expoſtulation, Eli, Eli, lamaſabachthani.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. The queſtion ſpringeth not out of doubting, or not knowing the cauſe of his ſufferings, and of Gods dereliction and forſaking of him, as if ſome ſtrange and unlooked for matter had befallen him. Far be it from us to think ſo! Jeſus Chriſt knew that he was now under the curſe of the Law, under the execution of Juſtice, under the wrath of God as our Surety. There be divers kinds of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical queſtions, in all diſcourſes and writings, and many in the Scriptures, ſee a taſt, if any pleaſe to turn to, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17, 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.29, 30. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1. and a thouſand more. Theſe are Rhetorical queſtions to expreſs in a word ſome great matter, that would require many words to expreſs it at large, nay, more then can be expreſſed or conceived. Such is this expoſtulatory queſtion of Jeſus Chriſt, when he was in the depths of miſery, <hi>why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> to expreſs the extream dolor and bitter ſenſe that he had of the Fathers dereliction of him, his Fathers forſaking him was the bittereſt cup that ever he taſted. He taſted the vinegar cup of death, but one drop of this is more bitter then all their gall &amp; vinegar; to teach man what a dreadful thing it is to be ſeperated from God and to aſſure us that he did bitterly experience what it is: it is penal Hell. This queſtion is to expreſs the uttermoſt and deepeſt degree of deſertion, next unto deſperation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.11. <hi>trouble and anguiſh, and none to help.</hi> It is to expreſs, that it is infinitely more deep then humane nature could have born, had it not been ſupported by the divine nature, unto which he was p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The ſecond conſideration, he doubles his out-cry with a claiming and catching hold on his Intereſt in God, ſaying, <hi>Eli, Eli, my God, my God,</hi> like a man ſinking into the bottomleſs deeps of loſs and deſparation. The words hold forth ſuch a frame of heart, which is ſo expreſſed in the Propheſie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.2. <hi>I ſink in deep mire where there is no ſtanding, I am come into deep waters, where the flouds overflow me, O m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The means he uſed to claim and hold his intereſt was, ſtrong cryes and Prayers; <hi>My God, My God, Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>who in the dayes of his fleſh when he had offered up Prayers and ſupplications, with ſtrong cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tears unto him that was able to ſave him from death, and was heard in that he feared.</hi> The full ſtreames of vindictive juſtice were ſo inflicted upon him, that it almoſt quenched and drowned the ſight and ſence of his intereſt in God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſo earneſtly catcheth at it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third conſideration is that the interrogation is partly ſupplicatory unto his God; to whom he ſpeaketh as if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>wilt thou not help me, O my God? Why haſt thou forſaken? O my God, help me!</hi> So it is expreſſed in the Propheſie <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.1, 14, 15. <hi>Save me O God for the waters are come in unto my ſoul: deliver me out of the mire and let me not ſink, let me be delivered out of the deep waters.

                  <p>JOh. 19.28. <hi>Jeſus knowing that all things were accompliſhed, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, ſaith, I thirſt.</hi> This is the ſecond word which Jeſus Chriſt ſpake after his three hours ſilent Agony, here be two motives that moved our Lord to ſpeak this word.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Knowing that all things were accompliſhed,</hi> in that which was the firſt and chief part of his ſuffering, in the puniſhment of loſs, in his Soul Agony; therefore now he gave chief attendance to his ſuffering of the puniſhment of ſenſe, which firſtly was inflicted, and lay upon his body, and is aptly, eminently expreſſed in this word of ſenſe, <hi>I thirſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond motive to this expreſſion is, <hi>that the Scripture might be fulfilled,</hi> viz. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.21. where he doth complain of the bitterneſs of the puniſhment of ſenſe, under thoſe two natural inſtances of hunger and thirſt, and the bitterneſs of all the relief that man afforded him, it was nothing but gall and vinegar.</p>
                  <p>In this word <hi>I thirſt,</hi> he ſpeaketh like a Conquerour, that cometh off a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour from a ſore battail with a wonderful victory, yet his nature ſo ſpent with thirſt, which is cauſed by the violence and extremity of the battail, and by wounds deep and great received in the battail, that he is ready to dye with the ſenſe of his fainting nature; which deadly and extream ſenſe of dying pain, maketh him cry out <hi>I thirſt.</hi> A like example of this painful iſſue of a glorious victory and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, we ſee in Sampſon, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.18, 19.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Here was the difference betwixt Jeſus Chriſt and Sampſon, Sampſon was relieved by God, and revived. Jeſus Chriſt had no relief, ſave what his Enemies gave him, and that was nothing but gall and vinegar, and ſo he dyed.</p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:65391:65"/>
                  <p>The firſt word Jeſus ſpake, held forth and expreſſed the bitterneſs of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of loſs, which is the firſt and chief part of the puniſhment of ſin.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond word doth hold forth and expreſs the bitterneſs of the puniſhment of ſenſe, which is the ſecond part of the puniſhment of ſin. Jeſus Chriſt felt ſuch extremity of pain and grief in this laſt Agony, that his humane nature was ready to ſink and dye, for want of ſome relief, and therefore cryed out <hi>I thirſt, Iſai.</hi> 53.5. <hi>he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> By this one word, <hi>I thirſt,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt ſheweth that he ſuffered the puniſhment of ſenſe, unto the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Prop. 1. The puniſhment of loſs fell firſtly on his Soul, on his body ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, by participation, becauſe ſo is our Communion with God, firſtly, the Soul hath communion with him, the body ſecondarily, and as Communion with God is acted, ſo ſeperation from God in way of puniſhment is inflicted and felt, by a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſenſe. The puniſhment of ſenſe falleth firſtly on the body, and reacheth the Soul ſecondarily by participation, therefore the torment of ſenſe, and the ſenſe of his torment is fitly expreſſed by this word of craving relief for his fainting body.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 2. Water, moiſture is the chief and greateſt part of aliment and ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the body, and therefore thirſt is firſt and chiefly felt and complained of, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> we ſee in Sampſon, and Dives in Hell cryed for a drop of water; thirſt is a ſinleſs puniſhment, which Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered to the utmoſt extremity, even till it kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 3. Bread is the ſtaff of life, it is the moſt ſolid ſuſtenance, therefore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpent with pain, grief, and torment, and ſuch like puniſhments, doth alſo greedily hunger, and vehemently deſire, and crave for ſolid ſuſtenance, as well as for moiſture, to cool and moiſten, ſo did Jeſus Chriſt in this his laſt Agony, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his hunger, as well as his thirſt, and both together do expreſs the fulneſs of his extream ſenſe of torment, which he felt in this laſt finiſhing Agony, hunger is a ſinleſs puniſhment, which Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered to the uttermoſt extremity; until it killed him.</p>
                  <p>His expreſſion of his ſenſe of hunger is not recorded in the Hiſtory, but it is in the Propheſy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.21. <hi>they alſo gave me gall for meat, and in my thirſt they gave me vinegar for drink.</hi> He cryed for, and needed both kinds of relief, in the ſenſe of the want whereof he was ready to dye, and quickly did dye; extremity of hunger and thirſt are among the greateſt of torments: when he had no other relief to ſpent nature, then gall and vinegar, he preſently dyed.</p>
                  <p>Prop. 4. It would ſet forth his extream ſenſe of pain and torment which his body felt for the ſpace of about twenty hours, to gather up a few Inſtances of the ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He ſuffered both loſs of blood, and great pain by their twice cruel whippings, and twice crowning him with thorns, and being withal parched and burnt with heat, which made him complain, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.3. <hi>my throat is dried,</hi> he ſweat in the garden, <hi>but now his moiſture is turned into the drought of Summer,</hi> Pſal. 22.15. <hi>my ſtrength is dried up lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Grief waſteth the body, pierceth the heart, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſoul; and many ſuch effects there be of grief: and now Ieſus Chriſt had a juncture of the greateſt griefs in the world, all met together upon him like mountains of ſorrow, and terror. All theſe are ſinleſs puniſhments of ſin, which he ſuffered to the uttermoſt extremity, until they killed him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 6. All this pain, grief, horror which his humane adverſaryes did inflict upon him, were infinitely ſharpned by the power of vindictive juſtice, and laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as our Surety; ſo that his puniſhment of ſenſe, was to the uttermoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, until they killed him.</p>
                  <p>The effect of theſe two words upon the by-ſtanders was twofold, Firſt, they gave him gall and vinegar in the extremity of his pain, to adde unto his torment, not to relieve him, which act is thus expreſſed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One run to doe it, that he might be ſure to make him taſte it before he was quite dead.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He took a Spunge, there ready for that purpoſe, after the Romane man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of tormenting Malefactors.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He bound the ſpunge upon a reed with a branch of hyſope, which were all ready for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He dipt it in the veſſel of galled vinegar that was ready there.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He lifted it to his mouth, and cauſed him to taſte, and he taſted it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond effect was, a miſtake in ſome of his word <hi>Eli, Eli,</hi> ſaying he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for Elias to come and deliver him. Whether this were a real miſtake of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or whether it was done in mockery as ſome think, I ſay not: but this is ſure, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.36, 37. <hi>The Souldiers alſo mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, and ſaying, if thou be the King of the Iews ſave thy ſelf.</hi> The end and intent of this giving him gall and vinegar was to afflict him, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt ſo complained of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.21.

The Sun did ſuddenly, perceptibly brighten about the ninth hour, which was the time of the death of our Lord Jeſus; which manifeſteth, that this darkneſs was not an effect of any natural cauſes, but of the divine power of God. And tendeth much to the confirmation of the apprehenſion of ſuch Reverend Divines, as think, that the darkening of the Sun, was a ſign of Gods hiding his face from Jeſus Chriſt in his ſpiritual deſertion, through his Agony upon the Croſs, which Agony being finiſhed, the Sun brightned, and Gods face of favourable acceptation turned unto him, and then he breathed out his Soul into his Fathers boſome.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The timous and ſpeedy death of Jeſus, by the wonderful and merciful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God prevented that Roman and Jewiſh cruelty in breaking his legs. That he dyed ſooner then they looked for, or then malefactors were wont to dy, or then the Theevs did, appeareth evidently, becauſe Pilate marvailed, and would not believe Ioſeph, who begged his dead body, until he called the Centurion that had charge of the watch, and he affirmed that he was dead. We ſee that the Romans uſed cruelty in putting malefactors to death by long tortures, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.34. executors are called tormentors, and when they deſire to diſpatch them, they broke their legs, to torture them to death, by torturing their Limbs furtheſt from their heart, when as a touch upon the head, would preſently finiſh their life, but Chriſt eſcaped this, by a divine hand.</p>
               <p>The occaſion that moved Pilate to command, that they ſhould be ſo killed, and haſtned to their death, was, the Jews requeſt that their legs might be broken, the reaſon which they propoſed was, becauſe of the approach of the Sabbath, and it was the time of their Paſsover feaſt.</p>
               <p>God commanded in the inſtitution of the Paſsover, that a bone thereof ſhould not be broken, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.46. <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.12. which the Iews religiouſly obſerved in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The infinite preſcience of God had reſpect unto this hiſtory of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, which we are now treating off. Theſe Iews poſſibly might ſee the reaſon of this branch of this Inſtitution; I dare not ſay they did ſee it becauſe the Text doth not ſay ſo. But if they had any ſuch intent to get his legs broke to blemiſh him, who is the true Paſchal Lamb? Then I ſay</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their wickedneſs was the greater, becauſe it was againſt light.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The infinite wiſe and merciful providence of God, is ſo much the more to be adored and admired in their diſappointment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The diſappointing and preventing of the breaking of his bones, is a mighty ſtriving of God to convince the Iews that Ieſus is the Paſchal Lamb.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fulfilling of the Scriptures in preſerving his bones from being broken, is a powerful confirmation of the ſaith of the Church to the Worlds end, that Ieſus Chriſt is our Paſchal Lamb, in whom we believe for ſalvation. When the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers came to break their legs, and did break the legs of the two Theevs, Ieſus Chriſt being already dead, they did not break his legs, yet one of them, without cauſe, neither knowing nor caring what he did, only to inſult over his dead body, took a Spear, and pierced his left ſide. It appeareth to be ſo, by that which iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the wounds <hi>viz.</hi> blood from the wound in his fleſh, and water out of the <hi>pericardium,</hi> which he pierced with his Spear, here we are to admire the all-ruling wiſdome of God, who by this act hath provided a wonderful confirmation of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65391:68"/> faith of the Church, that both our Sacraments are founded in the death of Chriſt, the water in Baptiſme, and blood celebrated in the Supper, confirm the faith of the Church to the worlds end, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6, 8. Again, by this act they did in part ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil that Propheſy, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>they pierced his ſide,</hi> O Lord Jeſus make haſte to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the other part of this gracious Propheſy, which ſaith, <hi>And</hi> I <hi>will pour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the houſe of David, and upon the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the Spirit of grace and of ſupplications, and they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only Son, and ſhall be in bitterneſs for him, as one that is in bitterneſs for his firſt born. In that day there ſhall be a great mourning in Jeruſalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Another memorable work of God that attended the death of Jeſus Chriſt, was the converſion of the Centurion, who had the charge of the watch that day, where ſee, firſt, The means of his converſion, <hi>viz.</hi> the dying words of Jeſus, the Earthquake, and other things, as the darkening of the Sun, and the brightning of the ſame, the rending of the Rocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>THe buryal of Ieſus Chriſt is a great point in Religion, both in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, and in the Hiſtory, and in the application. In the Hiſtory of this act of Chriſtian love, ſee firſt the perſons that did with due reverence perform this ſervice to the dead body of our Lord. Joſeph of <hi>Arimathea</hi> and Nicodemus, they would not leave his bleſſed Corps to the rude diſpoſal and uſage of Hangmen, and Executioners. But with their own hands they did reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently lay him into a Tomb. Theſe two men were honourable men, for they were both of them of the Council, but conſented not with them in their condemning of Jeſus, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.51. the ſame did not conſent to the Council, and deed of them, it is like that neither Joſeph nor Nicodemus were ſent unto, or called unto their Clandeſtine night Court, wherein Jeſus was condemned, they knew that they would oppoſe, they had experience of Nicodemus his oppoſing them; how many more of the Council might be abſent from that night Court, is not ſaid, it is like that it was carryed on by a Faction, that adhered to that violent young man Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas, and his Father in law Annas. For in the Hiſtory we find all the Council preſent, to be of one mind, therefore neither of theſe two worthy men were with them. Theſe were both holy men, and true Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they both of them had been timorous profeſſors, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.38, 39. Joſeph a Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt, but ſecretly for fear of the Jews. And Nicodemus who at firſt came to Jeſus by night, ſee a little what the Scripture ſaith of theſe, firſt of Nicodemus, <hi>John.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>&amp;c. he came to Jeſus by night,</hi> he was a well minded man, but weak in knowledge, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.51, 52, 53. <hi>Nicodemus ſaith unto them,</hi> (he that came to Jeſus by night being one of them) <hi>doth our law judge any man before it hear him, and know what he doth? they anſwered and ſaid unto him, art thou alſo of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee?

And now when Jeſus Chriſt was perſecuted to the death, and crucified, his courage ſtill aroſe, and his love abounded, for he joyned with good Joſeph, and brought an hundred pound weight of Myrrhe and Aloes, for the embalming of the Corps.</p>
                  <p>Joſeph was a very eminent, holy, and good man, all the Evangeliſts do inlarge in his commendation, and though he had been (as John ſaith) timorous, yet now he taketh boldneſs, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.43. and ſo did Nicodemus: if the Reader pleaſe to turn to theſe Texts, he ſhall ſee how amply the holy Ghoſt hath ſpoken of Joſeph, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.57, <hi>ad</hi> 61. <hi>Mark.</hi> 15.43, <hi>ad</hi> 47. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.50, <hi>ad</hi> 54. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.38.</p>
                  <p>Pilate granted to Joſeph at his requeſt the dead body of Jeſus Chriſt, theſe two honourable men took it down from the Croſs, they prepared a fine linnen bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sheet, newly bought for this purpoſe, they wrapped up the body with the aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks in decent manner, carefully laying Aromaticks upon all his wounds, in hands, feet, ſide, back, head, or elſe where. They carryed the body into a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den hard by, which was Joſephs, where was a new Sepulchre, hewen out of a Rock, which Joſeph had prepared for his own buryal, in which never yet had any man been buryed; there they did at preſent lay up the body, the approaching of the Sabbath permitting them to do no more: they rowled a great ſtone to the dore of the Vault, which ſhut it cloſe up. And ſo they departed.</p>
                  <p>Lo here we find the dead body of Jeſus Chriſt ſeparated from his Soul, laid up among thoſe that are gone down to the pit, under the power of death, and the grave, in the very bottom of his humiliation.</p>
                  <p>His Soul was in his Fathers boſome, in Paradice, far out of the reach of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, though in a ſuffering condition, becauſe in a ſtate of ſeperation from his body, there was he pleading and interceding for the Church. The good women ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved diligently where he was buryed, purpoſing after the Sabbath to perfect his embalming, for which purpoſe they brought and prepared ſweet Spices, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Surely they meant to have emboweled the Corps, and to have filled the body with ſweet Spices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for ſo was the manner of embalming of dead bodyes; they did not underſtand nor believe, nor expect his Reſurrection, though he had often foretold it.</p>
                  <p>But here behold the wonderful Providence of God, for ever to be admired, that by reaſon of the ſhortneſs of the time to the beginning of the Sabbath, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited them from doing any more at preſent, unto the body, and the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath, prevented them all that day. But they intended after the Sabbath to have perfected his embalming, for which purpoſe the godly women came very early, and brought their Spices. And when they came there, he was riſen before they came.</p>
                  <p>Here alſo we may behold and admire at the power of the Croſs of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that word of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.32. <hi>and I when I am lifted up will draw all men unto me,</hi> one would have thought in reaſon that theſe timorous noble Profeſſors would now have been more timorous then ever they had been; But behold the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for now they are more bold then ever they were.

                  <p>AS the firſt part of the ſufferings of Chriſt was before he was born, ſo the laſt part of his ſufferings was after he was dead and buryed, he lay in the grave, as Jonas in the whales belly, in a ſuffering condition until his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. After the Incarnation and birth of Jeſus Chriſt, the whole conſpiracy of Devils and wicked men was, to kill him and to conquer him by death: to remove him out of their way, after they had conquered and killed him by death, all their conſpiracy was to keep him dead, to ſeal him up in his grave, that he ſhould not riſe again, we may ſee what the Jews (by Satans inſtigation no doubt) did this way, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.62, <hi>ad</hi> 67. where ſee the time of this act, the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after the preparation, or celebration of the Paſsover, which was upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sabbath day, yea, though it was an high day, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19.31. being the morrow after the Paſsover. They pretended to be very zealous for the Sabbrth, to pick up matter againſt Chriſt, when he did good works of charity upon the Sabbath day.

What did they upon this Sabbath? they came to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and firſt ſee the term they give to Chriſt, that deceiver or impoſtor, we ſee here that his blood and death could not quench their rancor of heart againſt him. They inform Pilate that he had ſaid that he would riſe again the third day, which they deſired to prevent, uſing this Argument to perſwade Pilate to aſſiſt them, leaſt his Diſciples ſhould come in the night and ſteal away his body, and then tell the people that he was riſen again, according as he hath ſaid he would do. And the Effect of that would be worſt of all, our laſt error would be worſe then the firſt, if we let him riſe again, it will make us more odious to the people, then our putting him to death hath done.</p>
                  <p>Pilate impowereth them to make his grave as faſt and ſure as they can, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to do, by a watch, or any other means. Whereupon they went upon the ſame Sabbath day, they ſet a watch (ſtrong enough you may be ſure) at the grave, and ſealed up the great ſtone that lay upon the graves mouth, and now let him riſe if he can.</p>
                  <p>But herein we may behold the admirable wiſdome of God, and folly of man, that the very way which they took to prevent his Reſurrection, was a means to make his Reſurrection moſt evident and manifeſt unto all; the Watchmen were witneſſes of it.

I have purchaſed a pardon, I have purchaſed the Inheritance, the Kingdome; that by the right hand of divine power I may gather in all Gods Elect, whoſe ſalvation I have undertaken, that I may manage the world for the glory of God, and that I may ſubdue all their Enemies. <hi>And now O Father glorifie me with thy ſelf, and theſe thine Elect with me for my ſake, that they may behold my glory,</hi> for which I appeal unto mercy. Likewiſe alſo our appearance in Heaven when we dye, muſt be before the Tribunal of Juſtice, but we appear in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, we are converted, united unto him, we are members of his myſtical body, cloathed with his Righteouſneſs, and for his ſake we are accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pardoned, and welcomed to glory, ſo far as we are capable in that ſeperate eſtate. And for this we appeal unto mercy.</p>
                  <p>Now Jeſus Chriſt took out a pardon; now he took poſſeſſion of his purchaſed Inheritance according to the capacity of his ſeperate eſtate. Now he took the keys of hell and death, now was he ready to tread down all Enemies, Hell, Devil, Sin, Death, and Grave, by his triumphant Reſurrection. But theſe meditations do appertain unto the Exaltation of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>him God hath exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give Repentance to Iſrael and forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> Amen.</p>
